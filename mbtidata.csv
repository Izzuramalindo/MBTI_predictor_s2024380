68,68,Lana Del Rey - Ride,"Ride Monologue Lyrics[Pre-Song]. I was in the winter of my life. And the men I met along the road were my only summer. At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me. And my only real happy times. I was a singer. Not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet. But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky. That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken. But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is. When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home. They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people. For home to be wherever you lie your head. I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul. No moral compass pointing due north. No fixed personality. Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean. And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying. . Because I was born to be the other woman. Who belonged to no one. Who belonged to everyone. Who had nothing. Who wanted everything. With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it. And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me. [Song]. . [Post-Song]. Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people. And finally I did. On the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore. Except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun. I believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever. ""I believe in the kindness of strangers"". And when I'm at war with myself. I ride. I just ride. Who are you?. Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?. Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?. I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free80Embed",INFJ

90,90,Dean Lewis - Be Alright,"Be Alright Lyrics[Verse 1]. I look up from the ground. To see your sad and teary eyes. You look away from me. And I see there's something you're trying to hide. And I reach for your hand but it's cold. You pull away again. And I wonder what's on your mind. And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake. You start to tremble and your voice begins to break. You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's. They were my mate's. And I feel the colour draining from my face. [Chorus]. And my friend said. ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate. It doesn't matter, put the phone away. It's never easy to walk away, let her go. It'll be alright"". . [Verse 2]. So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent. And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head. And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone. And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on. But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday. It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake. And everything I know tells me that I should walk away. But I just wanna stay. . [Chorus]. And my friend said. ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate. It doesn't matter, put the phone away. It's never easy to walk away, let her go. It'll be okay. It's gonna hurt for a bit of time. So bottoms up, let's forget tonight. You'll find another and you'll be just fine. Let her go"". [Bridge]. But nothing heals the past like time. And they can't steal. The love you're born to find. But nothing heals the past like time. And they can't steal. The love you're born to find. . [Chorus].

Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip. What you cryin' about?. You got me. . [Verse 1]. Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad. When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had. I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh. I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry. 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there. Daddy's with you in your prayers. No more cryin', wipe them tears. Daddy's here, no more nightmares. We gon' pull together through it. We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?. Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it. We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls. When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls. Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you. Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news. I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems. The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me. All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did. We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me. But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'. Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers. But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason. I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something. We have no control over, and that's what destiny is. But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep. Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream. [Chorus]. Now hush, little baby, don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright. Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya. Daddy's here to hold ya through the night. I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why. We fear how we feel inside. It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby. But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh). . [Verse 2]. It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money. Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree. And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em. I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'. 'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job. But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in. Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block. And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar. Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college. Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it. And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart. And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart. Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back. On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment. And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara. And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD. And met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me. But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me. Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it. And you and Lainie were too young to understand it. Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit. And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it. I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand. 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud. Now I'm sittin' in this empty house. Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out. To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now. Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here. Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here. I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?. Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment. Related SongsCrazy In LoveEminemSpend Some TimeEminemRap GodEminem[Chorus].

119,119,Eminem - Lose Yourself,"Lose Yourself Lyrics[Intro]. Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment. Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo. [Verse 1]. His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready. To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting. What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud. He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out. He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now. The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow. Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope. There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't. Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows. His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope. He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows. When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's. Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody. Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and. [Chorus]. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go). You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go). You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better…. . [Verse 2]. His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping. This world is mine for the taking, make me king. As we move toward a New World Order. A normal life is boring; but superstardom's. Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder. Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over. These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows. He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads. God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father. He goes home and barely knows his own daughter. But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water. These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product. They moved on to the next schmoe who flows. He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera. Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner. But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah. [Chorus]. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go).

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged. I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed. I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage. But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher. Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper. All the pain inside amplified by the. Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-. Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family. 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers. And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life. And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder. Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter. Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna. Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna. Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's. Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got. To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot. Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not. Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got. To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot. So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not. This may be the only opportunity that I got. [Chorus]. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go). You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo. You better lose yourself in the music. The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go).

I need you so? 'Cause right now, you know. That nothing here's new, and I'm obsessed with you. Then I fell to the ground, and you smiled at me and said. . [Verse 1]. I don't wanna see you cry.

And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive. And well, maybe she's right. 'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me. See, I honestly don't even know why. I-I honestly don't even know why. . [Chorus]. Tryna keep my mind at bay. Sunflower still grows at night. Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes. Make it down, down, do-down-down.

184,184,Pink - Perfect,"William James Best Mi Presents: The Discovery of Game Law LyricsGame Law. . Money is the true calculation of intelligence.. . The alpha is he who overcomes size.. . Speed of Light:. 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s). . Law is what #happens. Theory is why.. . 0 is mathematic’s most natural place holder and 1 is considerably perceived to be less valuable than 0 in CONCEPT due to the diminishing effect of the numbers increasing on the number line. Output proportionally decreases with Value.. . Therеfore, 1 can be holistically understood to bе less of an essential value than 0 in the realm of math in that it does not balance any significant figures or match infinity in any perceived capacity other than that they both are mathematical expressions. 0 exists as a stronghold in its ability to maintain neutrality. It truly is the first understanding of all of existence.. . Objectivity is what is physically there.. Subjectivity is what is mentally and emotionally there.. . Deductive reasoning.. Certain.. Narrows down from general to specific ideas.. . Inductive reasoning. Uncertain. Generalizes specific to vast conclusions.. . *In God We Trust*. . We trust a calculator with mathematics. Why not trust a computer to determine the law on an individualized basis?. . Light is base 0, base 1, base infinity, and so on. Time is the only constant base in Mathematics and is base 12. Mathematics differs and is base 10.. The 12th letter of the alphabet is “L” and that L stands for love. Literally on the English language. It is clever in going from A to L for alphabetical order because L truly is Time. Lily Tien Mei Yu that is. She is also Light. And all of the other elements So Alphabet is sorta squeamish in its own way because the word itself is not in absolute order. Alphabet is short for ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. . SHORT IS SHORT. . Get it or don’t it makes sense. Short there basically means an implied impression was made on the word Alphabet by ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ MEANING ANYTHING LITERALLY DOES MEAN ANYTHING AS EVERYTHING DOES TO ITSELF AND ALL IS ALL. CATERIS PARIBUS GANGSTAS.. 10 is J. Scent sound and space are baseD. 0. 1. 2. 5. 10. 20. 50. 100 for the denominations of money. If we get the 000000000000000000000000000000s. (Thousands-Illions). The rest of the world are different numbers; it goes up to 9.. . . Space is red. *Alpha wavelengths detect red to be the first visible color of light in the spectrum of Light’s prism. Roygbiv. . Light is yellow. In that the Sun is White and Light is generally depicted in life as Some visible form on standard basis of what can be seen by the human eye, it is as common as marriage in the world that Light is Yellow at any level conceivable and more importantly HERE for the reasons that follow: Lily Yu is Asian (only 1/2 tho). The yellow power ranger is always Asian.. (Racist, but true. We must discriminate). The sun in basically all children’s pictures is depicted at the top of the page in Yellow crayon on a white piece of printer paper (this IS typically true, what am I getting at?) well. I’m pretty secure in my well-being but a nuclear bomb could go off at any time and I’d still say that yellow is going to be one of the colors used to describe what enlightened us as the lightbulb is generally yellow also.. Gold is cool. Lol ok. Light is yellow.. . Time is white. Time is RIGHT first and foremost and then is white as a sub equator to that. Just saying. It is only fair that Time be white. It is the most popular color in the world as it is generally what drives most people to do or Brown. White is default number 1 color in its perceived denotation and its relationship with the color black. Noting this, its duality with black (see lack) proves its worthiness of entity holding and sharing as its prominence in popular culture as what is good “light sighted” and divine will always move everyone. God is white. Time is god. Time is Tien Mei which is Lily Yu’s middle name. Which means since Tien Mei is half white, Time is WHITE. .. enuf. Scent is green. MONEY, cartoon odors, nature and its product of photosynthesis ie grass trees floral. Green. Marijuana. Green. Weed smoke. Green. Scent. Is green.. . Sound is blue. The blues, the good ole blues. Nothing like one color to change the way people see the world. It’s the only color that has a music genre because this really is the way that it is. We are as we are in time because of our origin “X” and continue to grow and learn throughout our lives until the end. Who knows where from there.. . Perfect is pink. Perfect is here defined as humanity or altruism in flesh in that all flesh is pink in its natural form as that is how it is intended to be when we are being true to our guarded selves. Our lips, eyes, organs, blood, muscles, and sometimes even fat, are pink genitalia too. At least they’re supposed to be in good health and without outliers (they’re always there but they don’t get in the picture as much as the commoners) Pink is perfect because we are made in Gods image and our Pink body parts are what make us perfect or divine as righteous human beings. Pink insides means you are living a good life. If we are all pink inside. We are all perfect inside too. Now we just need to learn to expose this pink correctly. Lips are a good start.. 5 is orange. 5 is basically just derived from Pool which has many definitions but most commonly is used to describe an assortment of something. Billiards, the swimming pool, a draft pool, it basically means a group of something with reasonable order. 5 being the value that signals for this definition to be triggered in all of our brains is that same oneness that we share in consciousness that provides us all with the tools we need to successfully carry out our lives as individuals. 5 being orange means nothing rhymes with fly like the 2 worded phrase “top 5” *It can be furthered that Orange is a derivation of Gold and that is a Hall of fame status worthy color of Orange on Basketball Houston and the Fruit. Orange will forever be known in the hall of fame as 5 gives competition an excellent source of stimulation as it allows for our pools and oranges to pile up at home, comfortably.. . Violet is purple. I really can’t make this more clear I’m just a teacher giving you the knowledge you need for your life so you can, may, and will pass it on to your young and your families and friends as I would if you were teaching me. Flowers. Ultralight beams. Grapes. Sometimes when you think about it, Spider-Man. All violet, or purple. They are one in the same and are pretty cool because they are just Space and Sound combined.. Love is Clear. It is pretty certain that love is transparent to all as the number one indicator of absolutely everything that not only we have been talking about, but everyone who has ever established a heartbeat or moved a centimeter in space, not to mention all of the other creatures out here exploring love and how clearly beautiful and incredibly stunning it can be agree that it is the one true uniting factor in all of the words on the English language. The non sequitur form of the word A is simple in its notation expressing a state of or at least implication of a state of being. Love follows a in the word alphabet as the L from the A that proves that love is the number one driving force of all action.   With that, and in clarity, we find reason and logic mold and mesh together to form truth, law, rule, math, time, and space, light, sound, and scent, and all of their respective interactions Ad’d into one. Here we are. Game Law. For the sake of another turn of the calendar page, 2022 here we come, and we’re gonna be shouting it cause it’s true. GOLD IS GOLD.. . . . ABC 123 Do Re Mi. . Rule(rs) on. 10 (Mat)h and 12 (Tim)e. Matthew and JAmes have an interesting relationship. Matthew believes he is a spawn of something greater than himself meant to do greater than what is expected of him. James believes he is the origin of everything and has a much more inward approach to things. Matthew is more social. James is more of an outsider. $Irony. Matthew and James are both names in the Bible. James takes on more names than Matthew as Matthew takes on more responsibility for his one name. James can mean Jim Tim Jimmy Timmy Timothy Tom J and or Time. Matthew can pretty much only be Matthew or Matt/Mat or Math. Mathematics and Time have an interesting relationship as their bases differ yet their concept stays true. Repetition of pattern is the key here. Time base 12 first and foremost but also base 24 sometimes and even 4/4 time if you wanna get music involved which basically means base 1. Math is base 10 which I’m sure you’ll hear soon and have heard already, but I digress.. . ♾Game Law is one of the Simplest Complexities in all of Life♾. . Math being base 10 basically means that according to both Math and Time Binary rules as it is either 1 or 0 or 1 or 2 which means that time has a different version of the expression but is basically saying that Time is expressing Binary in straight, and curved measures rather than in on or off white or black everything(something) or nothing measures. This means that time has binary backwards in that straight means value and curvy means let’s make it interesting. The added value Time brings from deferring to 1 and 2 rather than 1 and 0 is monumental in that they both share oneness and present a true Value to simply be in opposition of 1. Meanwhile, 0 is the first number on the number line and combats 1 with a lack of Value or the conceptual precedence of nothing. Imagine a circle gravitating everything to its center only to have it all disappear into an abyss of nothingness and do this forever. That is 0.. 1 is the line that demonstrates obedience, achievement, and task oriented planning. Alas, from nothing, we have arrived at a matter. 1 is matter in every way understood by all to be what is going on. It is the unity of everyone and our awareness of what it means to live. 2 on the other hand is a value of 2 ones bringing together the concept of separation or division, and social interaction or contact with others. The sense of individuality that one can get from the number two really depends on who you ask but in most cases it is determined that number 2 is liked by a niche group of good doers followed by a famed cripple of evil doers who both combat each other in 1 scenario, revolving around the nature of each characters’ interpretation of what value 2 brings to the table. 2 is the break from being straight to choosing to be curvy by means of an interventionist tactic of taking matters into ones own hands or taking control of the elements in a way that causes the oneness of everyone involved in this natural phenomenon of what we are experiencing as everything known to be life, to be changed in some way in that it will no longer hold the same value as 1 and will now be worth more in some way. Progressionist as it may seem The Value 1 does hold the most value in Math and in Time (as far as bases are controlled) and will forever pervade its past self as a value of 1 for the value of 2 indicates a major shift in paradigm around half of the magnitude of going from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 and so on. This mathematical expression is brought to you again by William James Best Mi and is sought after by anyone who is curious about how Game Law can attract your reality to your destiny:. . Game Law Sequence. sum of 0 and 1 is 1 and when you divide 1/2(total#s) it= .5 then you divide the percent change by the result of the initial equation and you get 1. As going from 0 to 1 yields a change of 1.. . .5(MiVariable)/1(numberendingfunction) = .5. .5 percent change or Yu so .5 Yu / .5Yu =1. So from 0 to 1 you get 1Yu. Then we go to the sum of 1 and 2 which is 3 and when you divide 3/2(total#s) it ends up equaling 1.5. 1.5(MiVariable)/2(numberendingfunction) = .75 .75-.5=.25 this is the change from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 .25/.75 =1/3 so .3333333333 is Yu at number 2. . From there we get to 2 and 3. 2+3=5 5/2= 2.5a 2.5/3 = .83 a/l. X=.83. .83-.75=.08/.83= 0.01. Then to. 3 and 4. 3+4=7 7/2=3.5 3.5/4= .875. .875-.83= .045 .045/.875= .05 or. 0.051428571428571. And so on.. 4 and 5 for .9. . . 0.916666666666667 for 5 and 6. 0.928571428571429 for 6 and 7. 0.9375 for 7 and 8. 8 and 9 for 0.944444444444444. 9 and 10 for .95. 10 and 11 for 0.954545454545455. 11 and 12 FINALLY Results in 0.958333333333333. . . As you can see the change going from 0 to 1 results in .5 and after that going from 1 to 2 results in .75 which is about half of the influence going from 0 to 1 had. Then you get closer and closer to 1 and it decimates from then on.. Yu comes from increasing from 0 to 0.5 meaning a change of .5/.5=1/1=1 and then goes from .5 to .75 going from 1 to 2 meaning a change of .25/.75 which equals 0.333333333333333. From 0 to 1 1Y or 1 number increased each move. From 1 to 2 .3333333333Y or one third Y increased each move. .08/.83 = 0.096385542168675 for 2 and 3. For 3 and 4 it = 0.051428571428571. For 4 and 5 it =0.027777777777778. For 5 and 6 it = 0.018181818181819. 6 and 7 = 0.012820512820513. 7 and 8 = 0.009523809523809. 8 and 9 = 0.00735294117647. 9 and 10 = 0.005847953216375. 10 and 11 = 0.004761904761905. 11 and 12 = 0.00395256916996. . See how it’s almost half the amount of work it takes to complete the next one and is diminishing due to that? it takes just about 0 work to get to ♾ And an infinite amount of work to get to 0. . HENceforth it goes from rooster to cock but never from cock to rooster. There is a natural order to things.. . This proves that just as in the law of diminishing return or law of diminishing marginal productivity in economics and business respectively, Yu or percent change total value from each to the next number depletes in value as the numbers go up the number line. So as the value increases by one each number, the amount of work it takes to increase in value by that same number, 1 is 1/3 then 0.096385542168675 or 3855421686747/40000000000000. This means we’re going from 1 (0-1) to .333 or 1/3 (1-2) to .096 or ~1/10 (2-3) to .051 or ~1/20 (3-4) to .027 ~ 1/40 (4-5) to .018 ~ 1/55 (5-6) to .012~1/80(6-7) to .009 ~1/100(7-8)to .007 ~1/140 (8-9) to .005 ~1/200 (9-10) to .004 ~ 1/250 (10-11) to .003 ~1/333 (11-12).. . This means it is roughly equivalent to reaching efficiencies in an increasing manner of 0 to 1 to 10 to 20 to 40 to 55 to 80 to 100 to 140 to 200 to 250 to 333 going from 0 to 12.

It’s just not the best hand to be dealt generally as it can’t attain a straight and holds the lowest card value coupled with an ordinary 7 card. The truth on pure logic and reason due to anyone viewing all the possible fields of subject, and more importantly multiple people viewing the game at hand and seeing that there are no moves to be made except the ones which were made, excited readers of the inter dimensional warp we have entered when discovering that Game Law is the ancient Guide of what is almighty wisdom and strength. Game Law. The rule which rules all rules. The game ends with the universal or majority rule/acceptance of the fact that at the final moment of the game, there are no more possible maneuvers to be made in the game other than one resulting in a win and loss for each opponent respectively. This is key in the assumption that we are able to gather enough reason, through movement, that we are capable of attaining purpose or achievement of any sort. Really it’s just a statement that is entertaining the fact that the fact that we are able to move is an extraordinary feeling and awareness of this law that we are required to move in order to be perceived to be alive is everything. Perfect as we are in existence of infinite bounds, we are able to experience anything (except for the all-inclusive conception of every applicable dimensional expression of situation that may possibly occur) meaning that we are everything, nothing, and living on a single tracked loop, in repetition, and as a whole consciousness individualized for each and every character to live life through as again, anything that moves is “alive”.. . . . 2 is the worst card in poker *Texas hold em or Black Jack*.

How is natural gas performed into a viable resource for fuel or money. The first thing that caught my eye is Encyclopedic Entry. But the first thing written was White color. And formerly, National Geographic, the title of the magazine the article is in. Now if we read more we find that natural gas is the remains of plants and animals. The remains of life after all. Plants animals and “microorganisms that existed millions of years ago” our ancient ancestors are paying/making for our moves. Methane, *probably the most abundant organic compound on Earth*.

Try to aim them in the center of a node or signal so that they are compacted together to form a tight mixture. Here we have arrived at what life has brought us to in what we shall call experiment. Something we are uncertain of but still test because we are curious. Now, curiosity kills, and also drives, same as food feeds and later becomes waste. The experiment here is random of course. As are all trains of thought but there are perceived Utopias which invite insipid chains of logic which pervade the rest and amongst all provide rule and water for the needy. We call these Kings or A’s. Nothingness exists as a form of day pleasure as well as night pleasure. Disses snakes. What can we get if we have nothing and find something within or outside. Where does matter come from? Everywhere and nowhere as the ability to distinguish difference is inherently absurd and an anomaly in brains owned by any name “I” has ever claimed to represent.

Postulate if you will. It balances in duality situations brought together in ubiquity that separate at a point, implying the divine intervention brings about a surprise which may be considered to be what is the meaning of what it is to be alive or to “be”. This implication of change, is what is being studied or perceived at the current moment (or in past or future endeavors) and prevails all other words and/or discriminations as movement.

Similar to how Be has the first definition come up with the word Verb stationed at the front and top of the definition box but not overtly at the top like in other common definitions it can be understood that Be is definite as Verb. Verb is not necessarily defined as Be but can be defined as noun if demonstrated in the right way. That being said for Verb the part of speech is designated where it is supposed to be meaning it’s part of speech is implied in its essence, however, the definition of be is altered in its part of speech being directly beside the word as if it is the words true definition or at least a synonym. Nonetheless, the definition of the word Noun is starting again with the part of speech as a part of the definition as it is spaced beside the word Noun and is denoted as itself or Noun. This means we have wrapped up the human language on interactive experience. Noun is Noun. The third person singular present tense won the game in that the dictionary definition proves as a calculator does that Noun does in fact mean and is defined by the word Noun and no other words are honestly needed for the discussion as it’s state of being declares its state of being and it’s life in the Cosmos will forever be fostered at home for all who wish to learn to speak their native tongue to completion.

186,186,eminem - beautiful,"Beautiful Lyrics[Intro: Paul Rodgers]. Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own. Everybody has a private world where they can be alone. Are you calling me?. Are you tryin' to get through?. Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you. . [Verse 1: Eminem]. I'm just so fucking depressed. I just can't seem to get out this slump. If I could just get over this hump. But I need something to pull me out this dump. I took my bruises, took my lumps. Fell down then I got right back up. But I need that spark to get psyched back up. In order for me to pick the mic back up. I don't know how or why or when. I ended up in this position I'm in. I'm starting to feel distant again. So I decided just to pick this pen. Up and try to make an attempt. To vent, but I just can't admit. Or come to grips with the fact that. I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet. And I know some shit's so hard to swallow. But I just can't sit back and wallow. In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:. I'll be one tough act to follow. One tough act to follow. I'll be one tough act to follow. Here today, gone tomorrow. But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—. [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]. In my shoes, just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you, let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to. Feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside each other's minds. Just to see what we find. Look at shit through each other's eyes. . [Chorus: Eminem]. But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. . [Verse 2: Eminem]. I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor. Everything's so tense and gloom. I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature. Of the room, just as soon as. I walk in, it's like all eyes on me. So I try to avoid any eye contact. 'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door. For conversation like I want that. I'm not lookin' for extra attention. I just wanna be just like you. Blend in with the rest of the room. Maybe just point me to the closest restroom. I don't need no fuckin' man servant. Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass. Laugh at every single joke I crack. And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!. Marshall, you're so funny, man. You should be a comedian, goddamn!"". Unfortunately I am. I just hide behind the tears of a clown. So why don't you all sit down?. Listen to the tale I'm about to tell. Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes. And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—. [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]. In my shoes, just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you, let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to. Feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside each other's minds. Just to see what we find. Look at shit through each other's eyes. . [Chorus: Eminem]. But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. [Verse 3: Eminem]. Nobody asked for life to deal us. With these bullshit hands we're dealt. We gotta take these cards ourselves. And flip 'em, don't expect no help. Now, I could've either just sat. On my ass and pissed and moaned. Or take this situation in which I'm placed in. And get up and get my own. I was never the type of kid. To wait by the door and pack his bags. And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed. For a dad to show up who never did. I just wanted to fit in. In every single place, every school I went. I dreamed of being that cool kid. Even if it meant actin' stupid. Aunt Edna always told me:. ""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."". Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there. Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this. 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen. Stop sign pole at eight-years-old. I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't. Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'. But I already told you my whole life story. Not just based on my description. 'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'. It's probably a 110% different. I guess we would have to walk a. Mile in each other's shoes at least. What size you wear? I wear 10's. Let's see if you can fit your feet—. [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]. In my shoes, just to see. What it's like to be me. I'll be you, let's trade shoes. Just to see what it'd be like to. Feel your pain, you feel mine. Go inside each other's minds. Just to see what we find. Look at shit through each other's eyes. . [Chorus: Eminem]. But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh. They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so. . [Bridge: Paul Rodgers, Eminem]. Lately I've been hard to reach. I've been too long on my own (Oh). Everybody has a private world. Where they can be alone (So). Are you calling me?. Are you tryin'g to get through? (Oh). Are you reaching out for me?. I'm reaching out for you (So). . [Outro: Eminem]. Yeah. To my babies:. Stay strong. Your Dad'll be home soon. And to the rest of the world:. God gave you shoes. To fit you. So put 'em on and wear 'em. Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are. Even if it sounds corny. Don't never let no one tell you.

And even sometimes he would go away too. Then one night, as I closed my eyes. I saw a shadow flying high. He came to me with the sweetest smile. Told me he wanted to talk for a while. He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me. I promise that you'll never be lonely"". And ever since that day. [Chorus]. I am a Lost Boy from Neverland. Usually hanging out with Peter Pan.

And Lost Boys like me are free. Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me. And Lost Boys like me are free. . [Verse 2]. He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe. Believe in him and believe in me. Together we will fly away in a cloud of green. To your beautiful destiny. As we soared above the town that never loved me. I realized I finally had a family.

Does he love you the way I can?. Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't. . [Chorus]. That should be me holding your hand. That should be me making you laugh.

235,235,SLANDER - Im sorry dont leave me,"Pat Stay vs Math Hoffa Lyrics[Round 1: Pat Stay]. Ready?. What up ho. Yo I knew you wasn't as tall as me man. Shit you try and reach my head. You look like you part of the clan. And Math ain't shit to me, I cheated on all my exams. So you already know I got this shit in the palm of my hand. You think I'm scared of you?. Dose me I dare you to try. I'm something terrible. Stare into the glare in these eyes. A fucking animal, a caribou compared to a lion. A bear on its hind legs ready to rip a deer by its spine. A Hannibal, covered in blood with my hands in the sky. And paint my face with it smeared on my eyes like ancient Native American tribes. He claims he packs that 9 milli, But that's clearly a lie. Cause it's simple mathematics, you never carry a 9. The Math professor, about to school you. Class in session, pass your test in. Put your hands up if you have a question. I'ma teach yo' ass a lesson, snatch your pencil. Snap it in half then rapidly stab your neck. Till the gash looks like a staph infection. You couldn't last a second in this class, or grasp the academics. There's charts and graphs. And your bars don't have connection like phones with bad reception. Pat's a legend like map directions. Cast reflections that crack glasses and smash the lenses. And I'm mad dyslexic, I read the wrong way a lot. So I'll twist your cap backward since you want to be Pac. I'll give you another one of those check this. I just battled Ice, The Wolf, a close match up. Two real dudes, that's why it was such a dope battle. You just faced Arsonal, but see what y'all have in common is you're both actors. Only thing you have in common with Wolf is your flow backwards. Pac, Wolf, flow backwards?. I slow roast rappers 'til they're so black Joe Jackson will cold smack them. Mob shit, roll past him in an old fashioned Volkswagen. Like the wiser's brotherhood; slow, clapping. No acting, thick like a wool jacket. I'll pull back and make you do a full back flip. Bull mastiff, predator drone blasting. Round 1, Math is done, closed casket. [Round 1: Math Hoffa]. Right now, Patty is like ""Finally...daddy is spending time with me."". Well I'm sorry Pat but I don't think your father's black. And besides, Hollohan was on the line with me. When Organik was banging your moms out. Hollohan turned and asked me privately. He said, ""Excuse me brother, but do you have an extra rubber?"". I said, ""I'm sorry, but I don't think you're the same size as me."". Then he said, ""Aw fuck it I don't need it."" Then he thumbed up and winked his eye at me. And I ain't trying to cry in pee so I stepped off the line quietly. Now I'm sure the reason crossed your mind. I saved myself the awful time. Of sitting in the clinic feeling like I titty fucked a porcupine. Cause this nigga Hollohan be burning bitches so bad he even caught some time. Don't y'all have free health care up here?. Now that's sick, but I ain't come out here for sponge god, I came for Patrick. You pink like a pussy. But a star is not your hat fit. You attack kids, the deceased, autism, you need your ass kicked. So I'ma break you down cause I'm a master with this rap shit. My facts hit ya like RZA playing a ninja blacksmith. Sucka Free Boss. Sucka Free. Why the fuck you claiming that shit?. When everybody know you and the G.O.D. you smoking crack with. Be out back, muah muah, sucking on a glass dick. Now you Pat Stay fans, close ya eyes. Get in a zone and relax. Visualize Nova Scotia, Dartmouth...an open door in a local flat. You go inside, you walk to the living room and who's sitting on the sofa? Pat. Now immediately you get excited cause you a fan and that's how you supposed to act. You go approach for dap and a cloud of smoke makes you choke and hack. The smell is like wet ass. That's when you finally notice Pat, suck a pipe. Fuck ya life, your favorite battle rapper is smoking crack. I mean I couldn't believe my ears when you confirmed it on the youtube. They said you was a dope rapper but who knew you do whoos?. I mean why smoke crack?. Was it a ploy to be blacker?. Did you misunderstand a black man that called you a ""cracker""?. You see Pat, smoking crack might get you more known as a rapper. But there's a chain reaction. Instead of staying Rich you prone to Dizaster. And crack don't make you think about goals and your squad's lane. So I guess all your hopes after this are cane/Arcane. You don't got bars like that. You do Seinfeld impressions and smoke hard white crack. So try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack. And I'll be here second round to bring the bars right back. [Round 2: Pat Stay]. You always saying ""I'm the realest"". Are you? I don't believe for a second. Cause if you were you wouldn't have to feel the need to address it. Your definition of ""real"" is intimidating the weak and defenseless. But there's a difference between being feared and being respected. See I'm a stand up loyal dude and to the streets I'm a legend. The same hand I'll reach out to help I'll beat you to death with. So fuck a Dose I'ma lethal injection and the needle's infected. So if Math tests or even questions me I'll teach him a lesson. That tough guy act is a scream for attention. Maintaining it must be hell. You think Canadians are soft cause we're nice but y'all are just scared to leave your cells. See that New York permanent tough guy act to me is just a scream for help. Cause you fucking Americans are stuck in this character and can't even be yourselves. Everyday you gotta put on that tough mood. God that must bug you. His moms be like, ""Love you."". He be like, ""Whatever. Fuck you."". He's an insecure little bitch, soft; emo. Wears a hat every battle cause he's bald; chemo. Ready?. Math Hoffa, hairline like your grandpapa. He'll snap on ya if you try to snatch his hat off him. Male patterned baldness, ain't that some dog shit?. Look up Math Hoffa's six battles if you haven't saw it. He won't even take off his hat for the national anthem. But you gotta put one against ya chest, so he carries a spare one. Yo, what kind of shit is that?. He goes swimming in his fitted hat. Eh, he'll give you daps but he'll never ever tip his cap. I know you hate that shit. Bald is beautiful Matthew, embrace that shit. Eh, real shit though. And the way you beg for Murda Mooks attention so sad it's disgusting. It's like you're obsessed with him. Do you wanna battle or fuck him?. And ever since Calicoe punked him his verses just don't have any substance. Cause his career was built off being a bully and Math never done shit. That's what acting so tough gets, you could've amounted to something. Every battle you've done since has been counter productive. You went from the highest paid battler to rapping for practically nothing. You turned your road to success into a path of destruction. Now your whole world's caving in. Bang, now your baby's sick. Karma's swinging back for slinging crack to that pregnant bitch. Dose get his way with him, chrome to his cranium. Click, click boom turns his dome to a stadium!. [Round 2: Math Hoffa]. He tried to diss me for the baldy. I bet I get more pussy. Every day I get realer, you just get more pussy. And why you using Dose bars? Why don't you use your bars P?. You just mad cause Drake came here to hear my bars P. I'm on the road but I still pack the house like an RV. Math Hoffa and King Of The Dot, oh it's a movie. So many people wanted to see this Blackout I thought I was Boosie. Pat you ain't scary at all, you just tall and you goofy. I bet this red devil be hanging out with Officer Doofy. You outta salute me. If you wanted to shoot me I'll respond with the clips like I was talking with Bootsie. I kill niggas, Hollohan's clan oughta recruit me. You trying to get it popping, this cross is a doozy. Like when Diz' parents not around, it's off with your kufi. This just a warm up, I'ma put you through a torture rack. I heard you trying to get on URL, I know the boss of that. So why don't you drop that N bomb while you getting off your raps. And right after you finish that bar I'll let you talk to Smack. But you from Scotia, straight up. So if I walk past and bump your shoulder. You slip my throat slower than a Russian soldier. That's how I know you sleep. Cause in the streets I see you come up closer. You bump my shoulder, especially someone that doesn't know ya. Right on a bump, off a hunch, I untuck my toaster. You turn I shoot your neck out like a fucking cobra. That's how Brooklyn do. Every time I look at you. I wanna put a fist, knife, bullet or a foot in you. Ain't no crook in you. I had to do this before Drake. Real niggas hate your face more than them court dates. It's fucking over. This kid's a fairy. I seen him choke on a The Saurus. But I bet he suck a dick and a dictionary. I run up on him like, ""How you gonna harm me fiend?. You in a gnarly dream that you Charlie Sheen."". I got some yardies that'll catch you at a party scene. And leave your skull all over your clothes like Ed Hardy jeans. Cause all you do is fish Pat. And that's a quote. But we ain't ever seen you throw a hook so that's a hoax. It was fishy, you was calling Arsonal a fake Crip and cracking jokes. Cause if he came across some real C's/seas, Pat will (paddle) boat. You don't got bars like that. You do Seinfeld impressions and smoke hard white crack. So try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack. And I'll be here third round to bring the bars right back. . [Round 3: Pat Stay]. It's about to get real personal. Real personal, I hate to say it. Y'all gonna wanna hear this. . Your grandma looks like Goldust. But she a pro that hoe's nice. Bends over like the bitch rolled dice her whole life. And the head was the best ever. She even let all my friends get her. That bitch went through more [?] than Fred Penner. Pat Stay peep the mack game, clean cut with a jacked frame. Stepping up where the hoes at, pssst, Axe spray. Eh, tugging on my dang-a-lang, strutting through your hood where all the gangsta's hang. And they be chucking deuces like orangutans. Straight from the get go, I let it be known I wasn't fucking around. I earn my respect without dick riding and sucking up to the crowd. Remember? I came here by myself and I ain't scared of no motherfuckers. His whole crew is like a Halloween in the ghetto, just a bunch of suckers. So go ahead, do exactly what the people expected. Bring up that old autism shit as if you were deeply affected. Cause trying to turn the crowd against me is just cheap and pathetic. But if that's what you have to do to beat me than at least you accept it. See me and Marv had a problem so I had to disrespect him. Check them. Got up in that ass; rectum. And that means you get emotional, that's how I can tell you soft. You got an autistic brother too, I'll kick his fucking helmet off. Eh, catch me dropping a big ole' stank of shit in a handicap stall. A retarded bitch comes wheeling up in here get her fanny pack robbed. ""Give me my candy back!"". ""Nah."". Smack 'em out of clammy palm. Then toss around like Jazzy Jeff with her granny panties half off. Eh, I'm on my white boy shit, better get it straight. I'm a white boy in every single way. Uh huh, got the top score in every single game. What? I fucking watch porn every single day. I'm on my white boy shit. Figured it was all a game 'til I'm at your door with a reciprocal saw swinging a ball and chain. I'll fucking bust in your crib buck naked just swinging like Carlton Banks. Like, ""Yeah bitch! Now don't ever say your dicks are bigger than ours again!"". Yo, first time I listened to Chocolate Rain...I fucking kicked my dog in the face. He lift up his leg to piss and I punched him in the fucking dick like Johnny Cage. Yeah, I got mad black in my family so I'd hate to make this a race war. But if you stereotype like I'm scared cause I'm white I'll break your face with a skateboard. He was trying to call me racist before. But that's wack as shit. He just got the wrong impression when I said I was riding through the hood and cracked my whip. But I ain't prejudiced even half a bit. Shit I could give a rats if you African. This my homie Zeno and that motherfucker is black as shit. Eh, he's a closet homo, keeps it on the low low. You probably know though, hump backs like Quasimodo. His pops expected it from how he always he always wanted Pogos. And by his wrists and how easy he can walk a Yo-Yo. I caught him checking out my hoodie, I was rocking Polo. He was staring at the horse's dick on the logo. Mafioso, I'll cock the fo' fo', pop it and watch in slow mo. As his bitch's head goes in a circle like a Versace logo. I'll drop this homo faggot. My reach is so long I could throw blows standing and no mo' slander I go solo. Banging, Komodo dragon I'll Go-Go Gadget fold yo' ass in half like a rolled up mattress. I blackout, woke up and don't know what happened. It's photographic. Cause all I can picture is snapping is taking shots and seeing flashes. Photographic, picture snapping, taking shots and seeing flashes. See my raps go over heads like turbans so I slow it down then, fuck it. I don't need no punchline shit. I'll paint the picture plain and simple for you, suck my dick!. I'm Pat Stay, I already fucking won this shit. So I'ma end this fucking battle off just like this. Sucka. . [Round 3: Matt Hoffa]. Pat 'bout to be Swayze. You gon' wish you died in your sleep. See your life is like the movie Ghost in my eyes and it's deep. Cause I seen your best friend set you up to die at your peak. And you should hide from them black guys that rise from the street. But I don't wanna bring up race, cause I know it ain't right, right?. I mean the race shit is fun, but it got old, like Excite Bike. But I was thinking about your career and I came up with a bright light. On how I could expose Pat Stay and what his life's like. You ever notice the similarities on all your biggest fight nights?. Think about your weigh ins (Wayans) brother, you ever feel like you White Mike?. But Pat think he The Joker {Matt flips his tongue a bunch} y'all see the way his tongue be popping out. That shit hella gay and it make me just wanna knock him out. I guess that make you Drago and I be playing Rocky Bal'. But Drago was a champion and Dizaster is the top renown. I bet if Organik said, ""I'll give you the chain if you top me now."". We'll see Pat Stay face down longer than Pacquiao. Yo Pat is wack, gassed up too, somebody pat his back, burp him. I hit his head and reverse him, show Pat his back and that's just off of jab impact. I'm only tapping Pat, spin him backwards. That's what you see when Pat is tapped. Matter of fact...stay. Cause you my bitch today. And I ain't saying pause. Cause ""stay"" ain't a word I say to broads it's what I say to dogs. It's time I show my neighbors, your behavior need a change of course. You need to pay the cost for what you claiming, cause you ain't a boss. Let's take this Canadian battle league. This ain't the one you came up off, but this the one you make your paper off. Why is it that they endorse an Arab from Cali and gave him the title chain to floss. When you and Hollohan could easily be the face up north. Is it because they don't wanna see you two crack heads caking off?. I mean, I personally know, you only getting paid a fourth. Of what they paid me to fly over and flame your corpse. Now in my mind, my logic, that shit sound like a major loss. Which makes you the lamest fucking boss I ever came across. See if I ain't take a plane here, I probably would take a horse. Cause I'm like Django, at the bar getting paid to off. And you over here fighting for your life cause you the slave of choice. And Organik is Calvin Candie. Cause we was both on the cell, I asked for Dizaster, that's when he spoke and said, ""Well.... I don't sell the niggers I don't want to sell."". Y'all see how I'm just killing him softly?. Even if I was pussy I couldn't get killed by a softie. I thought Organik was showing me love bringing me in to support me. But now I see, he was trying to help Stay up by bringing in coffee. I gave you pure comedy, you don't deserve hot quotes. Matter of fact, your whole career is like a knock knock joke. Knock knock, ask me. (Who's there?). Pat Stay. (Pat Stay who?).

240,240,Little simz - venom,"Venom Lyrics[Verse 1]. Life sucks and I never tried suicide. Mind's fucked even more than I realise. Time's up, keep it moving when she arrives. If you ever heard what I heard in my mind. Never try, you would cry, that's a lie, you would die. I don't wanna ever come down from a high. I'm in the best seat, from time, been a next breed. If you comin', come at me directly. Don't need no one to defend me. Soul's in a place even I can't get to, don't fuck with the deadly. Moon waves and open seas, quick coasting overseas. Fuck those who don't believe. They will never wanna admit I'm the best here. From the mere fact that I've got ovaries. It's a woman's world, so to speak. Pussy, you sour. Never givin' credit where it's due 'cause you don't like pussy in power. Venom. Venom. [Verse 2]. My, my, if you've ever heard what I've heard in the night. What a fright, must've been a parasite in my past life. I don't wanna ever come down from a high. My soul ascended to the sky, it's just you and I. God but I'm feelin' too alive. Tryna get me out of spite. Someone's gotta pay, I ain't talkin' big amounts. Some kind of physical pain. Some kind of traumatic shit. Niggas wanna see dead bodies. Probably not, they ain't rollin'. With no automatic clips. Moving scatty, all erratic and shit. Niggas pussy lickin', batty and shit. Oh, you mad? Then come at me, you prick. Make a move, better pattern it quick. I assume you'll be comin' for blood. That makes two of us, that makes two of us. . [Chorus]. Venom. Venom. Venom. Venom, venom. [Verse 3]. Night time to daylight we roll trees. Saved lives, invade minds and go deep. Oh, he wouldn't have guessed I'm so chill. Part of the day in the life you won't see. Part of the day in the life you can't be here for. It's the day in the life of OGs. Dealin' with inner demons that won't leave. Not a word, you will listen when my soul speaks. Down I go, so follow me, follow me, follow me.

If you ever heard what I heard in my mind. Never try, you would cry, that's a lie, you would die. I don't wanna ever come down from a high. I'm in the best seat, from time, been a next breed. If you comin', come at me directly. Don't need no one to defend me. Soul's in a place even I can't get to, don't fuck with the deadly. Moon waves and open seas, quick coasting overseas. Fuck those who don't believe. They will never wanna admit I'm the best here. From the mere fact that I've got ovaries. It's a woman's world, so to speak. Pussy, you sour. Never givin' credit where it's due 'cause you don't like pussy in power. Venom. Venom. [Verse 2]. My, my, if you've ever heard what I've heard in the night. What a fright, must've been a parasite in my past life. I don't wanna ever come down from a high. My soul ascended to the sky, it's just you and I. God but I'm feelin' too alive. Tryna get me out of spite. Someone's gotta pay, I ain't talkin' big amounts. Some kind of physical pain. Some kind of traumatic shit. Niggas wanna see dead bodies. Probably not, they ain't rollin'. With no automatic clips. Moving scatty, all erratic and shit. Niggas pussy lickin', batty and shit. Oh, you mad? Then come at me, you prick. Make a move, better pattern it quick. I assume you'll be comin' for blood. That makes two of us, that makes two of us. . [Chorus]. Venom. Venom. Venom. Venom, venom. [Verse 3]. Night time to daylight we roll trees. Saved lives, invade minds and go deep. Oh, he wouldn't have guessed I'm so chill. Part of the day in the life you won't see. Part of the day in the life you can't be here for. It's the day in the life of OGs. Dealin' with inner demons that won't leave. Not a word, you will listen when my soul speaks. Down I go, so follow me, follow me, follow me.

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles. Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love. Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life. And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of. [Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]. But now that we're done and it's over. I bet you couldn't believe. When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave. And I bet you think about me. . [Verse 3: Taylor Swift]. You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community. Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills. I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion. Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills. . [Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]. But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for. And you and I fell like an early spring snow. But reality crept in, you said we're too different. You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes. . [Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]. Mr. Superior Thinkin'. Do you have all the space that you need?. I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy. And I bet you think about me. . [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]. I bet you think about me, yes. I bet you think about me. [Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]. Oh, block it all out. The voices so loud, sayin'. ""Why did you let her go?"". Does it make you feel sad. That the love that you're lookin' for. Is the love that you had?. . [Verse 5: Taylor Swift]. Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul. Scared not to be hip, scared to get old. Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free. Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me. . [Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]. But now that we're done and it's over. I bet it's hard to believe. But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave. And, yeah, I bet you think about me. . [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]. I bet you think about me, yes. I bet you think about me. . [Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]. I bet you think about me when you're out. At your cool indie music concerts every week. I bet you think about me in your house. With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch. I bet you think about me when you say. ""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"". I bet you think about me34Embed",INFJ

Me and Steve cuttin' thru' trees in the weed. Yo, my jewels look like they go sleep in the freezer. They got women screamin' ""who's he?"" like a machine gun. Tell a hater ""speak up"", if not, shut your mouth. Man spend a bag on West and they claim that they shuttin' down. Three words, bunch of clowns, my life's like a movie. Joey treats the lambo like a hooptie. No time for groupies, no time for fake friеnds. I've never been thе greedy type, nah, I always break bread. Never been the shook type, blud, I always take risks. Trap to feed my family, you trap for the ratings. My bro's on some apeshit, don't look at them and screw your face. It's best you unscrew that shit before you lose your face. My young'un asked me for the price on a Z of coke. I told him '1017' like Gucci Mane. Fuck the drills, my team's full of mobsters. We shot drugs, we shot man, blud, we're on stuff. As yute man we used to play conkers. And times flew by, we started bussin' off our shotguns. Then we started catchin' cases, man got locked up. Some got life, some got shook, and went and got jobs. That's what the block does, it makes you or breaks you. When you're down and out the streets won't save you. The streets ain't faithful, the streets ain't loyal. They use and abuse you, then lay you in soil. I used to pray to God for new cars and a fresh chain. Now I pray to God he keeps my family and my friends safe. I seen nerds get killed for tryna get brave. Actin' bad like there ain't no space for a spare grave. It hurts to see my people with a stressed face. Money buys happiness so man are tryna get paid (Paid). [Chorus: Kelly Kiara]. Guilty by association. Guilty for my complications (For my complications). Tryna do right by doin' wrong. I'm just a product of my environment. . [Verse 2: Morrisson]. I got brothers six foot, they won't breathe again. I got some brothers locked in jail that won't be free again. You won't believe my stress, I'm tryna feed my family and feed my friends. At the same time I'm tryna feed my ends. I need to rest, lack of sleep got my head hurtin'. Two shots so this Henny got my chest burnin'. I know the feds lurkin' all over my team like flies and shit. They locked up Cherio for over ten birthdays. My mum is like ""Son, get a nine to five"". I told her ""That's for lazy people, mum, I work nine to nine"". I work nonstop, I'm paid but I want more. I've done a lot of winning but I've lost more. My uncle Alan used to pop pills and drink beer. Then put on Elvis Presley songs and talk about religious things. His eyes were filled with pain and struggle. Just a alchy, that's still my favourite uncle. Crackhead Ian used to stand there with his homeless sign. Beggin' 20p till he raise enough to phone a line. Crackhead Sue used to walk around in one crep. She OD'd and died on that park bench, madness. I just consigned my YG an ounce of coke. To me an ounce ain't nothin' but to him that's an ounce of hope. I spend more time with trees in the grow house than I do my kids in my own house, crazy. [Chorus: Kelly Kiara]. Guilty by association (By association).

289,289,aespa - life to short,"Genius Korea Community’s Favorite Songs Of 2021 Lyrics""0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)"" - TOMORROW X TOGETHER ft. SeoriOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. After the success of minisode1, came a new chapter for the group being FREEZE. Of course, being TXT, they experiment with each comeback and this one makes you go, ""Like, oh my god, so holy."" The lead song, ""0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You)"" is an emo rock style song with an anthemic and powerful instrumental. The amazing chorus and beat will definitely be one where you scream out the lyrics at the beginning of dusk, in the car (carefully, of course, safety is first), or vibing to it at 3 am to get in the feels. Just makes you wanna go like this. But don't be fooled by the melody, because the lyrics are truly on to break your heart. Being written and composed by Danke (lalala studio), “hitman” Bang, Melanie Joy Fontana, MOD SUN, RM, and Slow Rabbit (just to name a few), it is surely one of the group's best songs yet! The lyrics are emotional and romantic, centering on a person struggling for love. The strong concept and emotional lyrics are amplified by the hidden details in the music video. When it came out, you bet I was sobbing by the visuals of the music video and the lyrics. It made me fall in love with TXT all over again! Now then, better get back to something.......""ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ, ˢᵃʸ ʸᵒᵘ ˡᵒᵛᵉ ᵐᵉ...."". . —Hobschiske""술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride)"" - Brave GirlsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. While Brave Girls quickly reclaimed their title as Summer Queens with their hit single “Chi Mat Ba Ram” and viral sensation “Rollin’,” their best song came with the release of “술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride).” A sequel to their 2020 city pop single “We Ride,” the new song is a shimmering display of their talents. Featuring the girls' dreamy vocals and harmonies over a synth-wave beat. The song also infuses a little bit of rock which was quite trendy this year. The track draws upon all the new trends without overdoing them. The music video and the lyrics of the song compliment the sonic production of the song that describes the emotional journey following a breakup. The track finds the girls embodying their name. While they are heartbroken over a breakup, they end the song with the realization that they are brave enough to overcome the heartbreak. This realization is also represented in the music video, shown with member Yuna dancing in the rain being carefree, and Eunji burning the bouquet she held on to. ""술버릇 (운전만해 그후) (After We Ride)"" not only showcases diversity in their discography but also maturity and reminds listeners that they are senior artists in the industry and not just a one-hit-wonder act.. . —ssaa10dec""Alcohol-Free"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Ever since the release of ""Fancy"", TWICE keeps surprising us comeback after comeback by trying different sounds. After offering their own take on tropical house with ""More & More,"" exploring a more retro, Dua Lipa-esque vibe on ""I Can't Stop Me,"" and finally showing a darker side with ""Cry for Me,"" they are now back with a summer song that feels really unique, ""Alcohol-Free."" The unexpected association of bossa nova with hip-hop (!) works amazingly well and creates a refreshing atmosphere that I haven't experienced in other K-pop songs. The members' vocals particularly shine, with smooth vocalizations at the end of each sentence. Listening to the track takes me away from my daily life for a while and I find myself chilling on a sunbed with a cocktail in hand—whether a mojito, margarita or alcohol-free beverage—exactly what a good summer song is supposed to make you feel like, right?. —ab212""Boom"" - DPR LIVE ft. DPR IANOriginal Song. ""Boom"" is a sexy song full of fun melodies and summer vibes. This track is my favorite from DPR LIVE's EP IITE COOL and it features DPR IAN, whose album I'm obsessed with (and in my opinion is AOTY). Having the two together again after ""No Blueberries"" was definitely a treat. They are absolute musical geniuses. During your first listen, you would never expect the alt-rock interlude with angsty and vulnerable lyrics. This builds all the way up to finally explode back into the main song like a true rollercoaster, leaving you with the same feeling of adrenaline when the ride is over.. . —EleventhCassette""Butter"" - BTSOriginal Song. I was very excited and looked forward to ""Butter"" as soon as BTS announced its release.  And as I thought, they didn't disappoint me. It was a great song and I can't stop listening to it ever since.  For me, the best part of the song is the chorus & verse 3 (especially SUGA's rap part), I also love the instrumental part after the second chorus. RM's songwriting made the song feel even more personal. I believe this song has better proved BTS' success and it showed how perfect BTS are. The music video is a visual treat and all the members looked amazing. With ""Butter,"" BTS has once again given us fans a summer anthem to vibe all year long.. . —a'A""Cloud"" - WavyCake ft. Donutman & ClavitaOriginal Song. A single that was included in his third full-length album BAGGAGE. At first, I didn't think the collaboration would happen, but I was sure it would be catchy since WavyCake, as well as Clavita—an uprising R&B singer with distinct sounds—are known for that. The chorus that was brought by Clavita is perfectly stuck in my head due to its witty lyrics, and Donutman made sure to enhance their chemistry.. . —sa44""Drunk-Dazed"" - ENHYPENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of ENHYPEN; when Drunk-Dazed came out, I had already put the group off to the side, despite having watched the entirety of i-land. However, ""Drunk-Dazed's"" horror carnival concept really helped me hit the nail on defining what kind of a group ENHYPEN is; before, as a casual listener, I often felt as if ENHYPEN and other boy groups sometimes overlapped in sound and concept. ""Drunk-Dazed"" flowed very naturally and never lost the momentum gained by the bass starting in the first verse, despite the melodic verses, chorus, and bridge all sounding distinctively different. The chorus is simply phenomenal: the repetition of the lyrics conforms to the song's concept and makes you feel like you're stuck on a carnival ride, and the high pitched variations in the lyrics convey a wonderful anomaly to conformity, but never jarring nor frightening. The dynamic, yet sharp choreography of ""Drunk-Dazed"" takes the song one step further to showcase the ability of HYBE and ENHYPEN to seamlessly weave together the music and the arts.. . —ANC613""End of the World"" - EPIK HIGH ft. G.Soul Original Song | Romanization | English Translation. The golden voice of Korea (puns intended) teamed up with my favorite South Korean trio, Epik High, on Epik High Is Here 上. Despite that the album is packed with high-quality music, this ballad is one of the best songs on off it. The song asks, 'What if the end of the world comes? What will be the most important then?' what hits harder in uncertain times we are living in now. The rough rap of the questions asked paired with GSoul's soothing vocals really hits differently, and makes it feel even nostalgic. But this song, contrary to appearances, is not sad, and the conclusion is that after all, you have to dream, love and live life to the fullest, as if there was no tomorrow, even if the world is dark and things seems out of control.. . —siannve""Film out"" - BTSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Not everyone knows, but BTS are masters in creating atmospheric soundtracks, and so it was this time. ""Film out"" is the fourth BTS' song made for the Japanese cinematography (after ""Don't Leave Me,"" ""Stay Gold,"" and ""Your Eyes Tell""), and acts as the main theme for the film Signal: Long-Term Unsolved Case Investigation Team. This moving ballad, co-written by Jung Kook, really shows off their vocal abilities and proves that they can sing and rap in any language—the harmonies, the flows, not a single one feeling out of place in the song. The song is filled with emotions and soulful vocals, and I'm sure it'll have a special place in many hearts. Despite being sung in Japanese, it has topped the charts in over 100 countries, including the world's biggest music markets, such as the US, Japan, and the UK.. . —siannve""First"" - EVERGLOWOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. For girl groups with powerful concepts, EVERGLOW is a name that should come to mind. The sextet has explored many different genres, such as powerful military-style ""Adios"" and retro ""La Di Da."" With ""FIRST,"" EVERGLOW continues to prove they are aiming for the top, while also being the ""firsts"" exploring varieties of power concepts. ""FIRST"" is a powerful trap-EDM track that makes me feel like I'm about to face off against the final boss in a video game (which may as well be EVERGLOW). Even with a new concept, the song is still so EVERGLOW and it shows off the girls' talents quite well. Leader Sihyeon got a big share of the vocal parts, allowing her to show off her vocals alongside Mia. Onda, lacking recognition throughout their career, got the center position for the dance break. Aisha and Yiren made the stage theirs with their amazing charisma. And main rapper E:U, though short, had an extremely memorable rap part, adding the last bit of spice needed to make ""FIRST"" one of the most powerful songs of 2021.. . —PlanNine""Gone"" - ROSÉOriginal Song. Rosé's vocals on the songs of BLACKPINK generally packs a punch and have a certain attitude to it. But, ever since hearing her part on the bridge of ""Lovesick Girls"", I was craving for the soulful and emotional side of it. And ""Gone"" delivered exactly that. When I first heard the teaser of the song, I was immediately in love with the melancholic and slow guitar strums, and the chorus was also already latched onto my mind. And when she performed the song on THE SHOW, it immediately solidified its position on my top favorite songs of all time. Every time I hear the song, a breeze of nostalgia sweeps over me. And despite the lyrics talking about hardships and pain, it gives me warm waves of comfort.. . —Nosyneko""I Can't"" - CitiOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. You might have seen this artist posting covers of popular songs by your favorite artists. The R&B singer-songwriter Citi has been slowly gaining traction on social media for his mellow sound and soothing vocals. Released earlier this year, ""I Can't"" is a heartfelt R&B jam with a somber yet hopeful message. A track about not giving up on a loved one, ""I Can't"" is a slow-burning track that goes back to his simple songwriter roots carving an intimate space for him and his listeners. Citi's soft sound is paving him to be an artist to look out for in the upcoming year.. . —ssaa10dec""LAST WALTZ"" - TWICEOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. ""Last Waltz"" had an interesting trajectory for me. This left me astonished on the first listen. That orchestral melody became one of the highlights, plus their exceptional vocals proved they could pull off a certain kind of style that TWICE rarely unveils. This is the kind of song I’ve always manifested for them to include again in their discography after “Cry For Me."" The song blossoms into a pleasurable track that brings a hailing shot of seductiveness. If I had it my way, I’d bump up the track’s beat and dance to it.. . —Deign_Paul_Archie""Life Is Still Going On"" - NCT DREAMOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Seeing the reactions to the song online, “Life Is Still Going On” really captivates every listener’s heart. The grip that this song has on me makes me so happy, and because of that, I bop to it all the time. It’s a pretty, aural-leaning tempo track, that is made more engaging by its standout raps; the song succeeds on the strength of its groove. After a flimsy, languid verse, the track’s chorus sets its rhythm and is definitely a song to vibe to. I admire the variety of textures and structures used because the song gives a fun sense of interplay, made even more fitting with a fair dose of blessed ad-libs. The finished product feels like the soundtrack to a peaceful scene.. . —Deign_Paul_Archie""LOTUS (H1GHR Remix)"" - Jay Park, JMIN, BIG Naughty, pH-1, TRADE L, Woodie Gochild, JAY B & PARK HYEON JINOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. H1GHR MUSIC's Jay Park, JMIN, BIG Naughty, pH-1, TRADE L, Woodie Gochild, JAY B, and Park Hyeon Jin teamed up and released a remix of FORCEPARKBOIS' ""LOTUS."" The original song was released by the Malaysian 15-member hip-hop collective in the February this year, and made a hit with millions views and streams both on YouTube and Spotify. The remix, released only on YouTube, doesn't go for a commercial success, but instead of that focus on showcasing exceptional hip-hop skills of artists involved, and on praising the South East Asian rap scene, what Jay Park accents in his verse. The song samples the original chorus and adds the unique verses from H1GHR's hip-hop and R&B artists, and while each of them has a distinct style, they all together sound smooth, and none of them disappoints. The Korean remix follows other all-stars rap remixes from across the region—""LOTUS (Singapore Remix)"" and ""LOTUS (Brunei Remix)."". . —siannve""월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)"" - ONEUSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. With the widespread globalization of music, this year saw pop music continue to redefine itself, thanks to a slew of captivating fusion hits. Korean boy group ONEUS released one such track, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA).” A traditional Korean song infused with nu-disco and city-pop beats, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)” combines many different cultures, making for an infectious pop hit unlike any you’ve heard before. Written by the group’s members, “월하미인 (月下美人: LUNA)” makes reference to the Queen of the Night, a rare species of cactus that blooms only at night and wilts before dawn. The Chinese phrase in the title can be translated to “beauty under the moon.” Together, the two titles exemplify the powerful sentiment explored throughout the song. The power of the song can be seen as it earned the group their first-ever music show win and lots of critical praise by music lovers across the globe.. —ssaa10dec""Magic Carpet Ride"" - NCT 127Original Song | Romanization | English Translation. R&B is a genre that NCT 127 has grown comfortable with since debut, but still, they are always able to be innovative with it. Dynamism, talent, and years-long expertise are shown through ""Magic Carpet Ride,"" a distinctive piece that features NCT 127's ability to tell a sweet love story chaperoned by their velvety, skilled vocals and low-paced rap. From the first listen, the audience can easily be swept away by the song's warm ambiance, which is enhanced by the emotions and devotion that emanates from each member as the bridge and last chorus arrives. The multilayered 2000s inspired sound is recognizable and provides an enjoyable atmosphere while NCT 127's main vocalists seamlessly help connect one verse to another. Among every R&B-based release of NCT 127, ""Magic Carpet Ride"" easily paves its way as one of the most memorable and special tracks, as the group's polished teamwork is effortlessly detected and admired.. . —loveholic""MAVERICK"" - THE BOYZOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Slowly but surely achieving international success, THE BOYZ had two well-received comebacks in 2021. While ""THRILL RIDE,"" the first, was a summery and vibey song, the more recent ""MAVERICK"" takes the cake as their most intense title track, sporting a darker concert than they have ever done before. The song's narrative centers around a maverick—someone who is independent and does not conform to societal standards—accompanied by a survival game concept that is reminiscent of Netflix hit 오징어 게임 (Squid Game), which blew up a month prior to the song's release. The music video portrays this concept well, with members in intense confrontations with one another, leaving us on edge to see where this plot will lead. Aside from standing out amongst the crowd, the song showcases the group's many strengths. The verse progression alternates between fierce rapping to strong vocals, eventually leading into an intense chorus with their signature synchronized choreography. Overall, this is one of THE BOYZ's strongest comebacks and is definitely a sign of success for them in 2022.. . —PlanNine""Next Level"" - aespaOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. After already being heralded as ""monster rookies"" thanks to their November 2020 song ""Black Mamba,"" aespa truly shine on follow-up single ""Next Level,"" which reimagines A$ton Wyld’s 2019 song of the same name. While ""Black Mamba"" served as more of an intro to aespa’s half-digital concept, ""Next Level"" lets Giselle and Karina show off their rap skills while Ningning and Winter highlight their fluttering vocals, with different sections of the song taking inspiration from different genres. It’s proof that the success of ""Black Mamba"" was more than just beginner’s luck, and that aespa is here to stay as one of the most promising new girl groups.. . —VinylZombie_MCR""Odd Eye"" - DREAMCATCHEROriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. In late January, DREAMCATCHER came back in full force with their title track ""Odd Eye"" from their EP Dystopia: Road To Utopia, the end of their 'Dystopia' trilogy. ""Odd Eye"" starts off with strong and mysterious melodies, the lyrics portraying how humans keep chasing a perfect world that doesn't exist—a Utopia. The pre-chorus builds the song up with haunting synth sounds until the chorus drops with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever. As a breaker, Dami's rap verse has a more electronic vibe, and my favorite lyrics in the song, ""Struggling with meaninglessness, we seemed to be in the same place again with endless thirst. No matter how you chase a mirage, it's not there."" In the bridge, I always imagine that's how DREAMCATCHER would sound like after a big explosion, a breaking point where they've realized their reality and lost all hope. I love the choreography at this part, leading to the girls' powerful spinning jump in the last chorus. Vocally, the highlights there are Yoohyeon's and Siyeons's harmonies and backing vocals, landing the song to a breathtaking end. Besides the musical aspect of the track, the music video for ""Odd Eye"" is the best film release of DREAMCATCHER so far. The girl group has always had great music video concepts, but now they've perfected them with amazing direction, special effects, artsy sets, and cyberpunk imagery. With the conclusion of the 'Dystopia' series, I can't wait to see what else DREAMCATCHER has in store for us.. . —EleventhCassette""Paint Me Naked"" - TENOriginal Song. The perfect demonstration of Ten's attributes as an artist is conveyed through ""Paint Me Naked."" Not only is it bright, with its addictive beat and changing colors, but it also showcases Ten's creativity and devotion for his art, as he took part in the creative process of the release. As a fan of Ten, there is nothing more inspiring and awe-inducing than seeing him reinvent himself with every work of his, and it is easy to tell that he is always trying to challenge himself and go on new adventures. May it be either his spotless work ethic, the power that the pop-rock song oozes, or the facility with which Ten can belt out high notes and lighten up a gloomy mood through his charisma and dancing abilities, but ""Paint Me Naked"" is a delightful piece that brings out the best of Ten and showcases him as one of the most complete performers out there.. . —loveholic""PTT (Paint The Town)"" - LOONAOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. ""PTT (Paint The Town)"" is probably the song that I was most excited about so far this year (alongside ""Like It Hot"" by GWSN). It was really exciting since member Haseul, who was put on hiatus for over a year, was returning. This was my first comeback with her and it definitely made me like the song more. The song features a catchy Bollywood instrumental and honestly was really different from what I expected. The bridge along with the pre-chorus were the best parts of the song in my opinion. I also adore the part that Go Won and Vivi share. There is also a Japanese version of the song, so if you enjoy listening to J-pop more, I would recommend that version. The chorus has an easy-to-listen beat drop which compliments the piece a lot. The lyrics to this song provide confidence as LOONA always has inspiring lyrics that will make you feel like a badass. ""PTT (Paint The Town)"" is a song that I'd recommend if you enjoy strong concepts.. . —seokyoung""Ready to love"" - SEVENTEENOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Thematically SEVENTEEN’s “Ready to love” was one of the most interesting takes on romantic love this year. “Ready to love” is as much a statement as it is an offer. The ‘me’ of the song is offering themselves and their love to the one they love. If this love will reach fulfillment is up to them. It is, as the album is aptly titled, “Your Choice”. This situation leads to a song filled with a nervous but hopeful energy, that is exemplified through the steady beat which pushes the song forward like a pulsating heart. Anxiety and anticipation swell, as more and more instruments, kick in towards the chorus, needing a release or catharsis. Additionally, the choreography is probably one of SEVENTEEN’s most elegant ones to date, reminiscent of “Fallin’ Flower” or “Don’t Wanna Cry” in its combination of difficult moves, flowing gestures, and narrative formations. It perfectly encapsulates the emotional vulnerability of putting yourself out there, unsure whether one will be accepted or rejected. The song doesn’t indicate what the choice is or ought to be. Instead, it leaves the listener on a reverberation that feels like an empty space, as one anxiously anticipates a response.. . —sianii""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" - DKBOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Backed by strong synths that lay a nice foundation for DKB's powerful vocal and rap lines, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" was an interesting choice for a comeback single. Relying on lo-fi R&B beats, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" is quite different from typical boy group title tracks which is what makes it stand out in the crowd. The soothing track is perfect for looping during study sessions or being played on chill summer nights by the beach. The looping factor feeds into the song's theme which is about repetition and the cycle of pain in relationships. The music video accompanying the song is a visual masterpiece that captivates its viewers from the start. With a powerful and diverse discography under their belt, ""왜 만나 (Rollercoaster)"" is a great addition to DKB's roster of songs.. . —ssaa10dec""Spider"" - HOSHIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. It is kind of hard for me to believe that “Spider” is Hoshi’s first proper solo release. Hoshi’s command throughout the song and the track’s ability to lure in its listeners like a spider to its prey is one of the many reasons why I love the song. Weaved over a sultry electric guitar, “Spider” lets Hoshi shine not only as a performer but also as a vocalist. With 13 members in the group, Seventeen songs often struggle with the vocal part distribution. With a solo release, Hoshi is once again able to remind listeners of his talent as a singer. The music video and the song’s insane choreography are other highlights of this debut for me. From his forehead (God bless his stylist) to the upside-down acrobatics, the music video was filled with moments that fans can instantly fall in love with. With “Spider,” Hoshi proves why he was chosen as the performance leader in Seventeen and also makes his impact as a soloist with tremendous potential.. . —ssaa10dec""색안경 (STEREOTYPE)"" - STAYCOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Riding the success of the ever-catchy ""ASAP"", ""색안경 (STEREOTYPE)"", STAYC's second comeback of the year, cemented the group's status as an up-and-coming 4th gen girl group, despite the small size of their company. Produced by HighUp CEO Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon, this future bass electronic-pop track was destined for success, and indeed delivered STAYC their first three music show wins as a group. The song's lyrics present a message about not wearing tinted glasses - not coming into a situation with predisposed stereotypes and thinking outside the box without judging people by their looks. In typical STAYC fashion, their outstanding vocals, particularly in ISA's bridge solo, also blew up on TikTok after the song's release, accelerating their rise to popularity even further. As a group that can't seem to make a bad song (though their debut track was ""SO BAD""😉), I cannot wait to see what STAYC has in store for us in the coming year.. . —LukeNolastname""슈퍼 참치 (Super Tuna)"" - JinOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Released on the celebration of his 29th birthday, without any promotion, and with the performance video shot quickly at the theme park he was visited during his spare time, it was simply co-written, produced, and recorded spontaneously by Jin. All that because this upbeat one-minute trot song supposed to be ""just"" a small surprise-gift shared by Jin with the ARMYs (BTS' fans). Little did he know because this hilarious ode to his love for fishing is an instant bop and took the world by a storm. ""Super Tuna"" has been trending #1 on YouTube under the Music category for 16 days straight, what has never been done by any Korean soloist before. The song has also made its mark on Billboard Top 10 Hot Trending Songs. Moreover, it has inspired several memes, as well as a dance challenge, where people show their renditions of the 'super tuna dance' (which was choreographed by Jin himself)—from the TikTok celebs and Baby Shark creators to real tuna factory workers and the South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (currently, the #SuperTuna TikTok hashtag accumulated over 200 million views). The song made even unexpected waves like Korean news outlets covering serious reportage with the experts to break down the song, or leading to surge in sales of nautical dog toys. But despite all of these achievements, most of all, ""Super Tuna"" is a remarkable mood enhancer and reflects one of the lesser-known to general public but wonderful sides of Jin's character. Now there is nothing left but to wait for the second verse.. . —siannve""The Dreaming"" - MONSTA XOriginal Song. The closing track from MONSTA X's second English language album, ""The Dreaming"" is one of the most beautiful tracks in the group's discography. With a somber tone, the track stands in contrast with most of the album. The track's bittersweet sentiment is one that resonates the most with listeners. ""The Dreaming"" brings out the sensitive side of MONSTA X while giving some food for thought, particularly for those with starry ambitions. The song encapsulates the group's journey quite well who have many 'trophies to show' for their achievements, but their real achievement is their growth over the past six years. The song features some of the group's best vocal performances which amplify the heartfelt message of the lyrics, especially the chorus which sings ""Is finding the gold worth losing the rainbow? / The colors are there / Are they the same though?"". . —ssaa10dec""소리꾼 (Thunderous)"" - Stray KidsOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. After a massively successful 2020, Stray Kids made their 2021 comeback a bang, proving once again they are K-Pop trendsetters. ""소리꾼 (Thunderous),"" is a high-energy hip-hop track, with stylish raps and a strong vocal buildup to a catchy hook and a danceable chorus drop. The song's concept and uniqueness comes from the wordplay of ""소리꾼"" which doubles as ""noise maker"" and a term for traditional Korean singers of 판소리 (pansori). In the song, Stray Kids dub themselves as the ""noise makers,"" going with the theme of their ""noisy"" album, NOEASY. They will not conform to a mold that is expected of them and will continue making their music (their noise). The song incorporates several elements of traditional Korean music in the song and the music video, with Changbin rapping in a 판소리 (pansori) flow and instruments including drums, cymbals, gongs, and other percussion and woodwind instruments. Stray Kids are always finding new ways to express themselves through their music, and the take they took this year is definitely one to remember.. . —PlanNine""Vanilla"" - KAIOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. Following the song's name, KAI's honey voice shines on the mellow-sounding ""Vanilla,"" a melodiously intimate track that highlights the artist's best elements as a vocalist. The slow-paced yet sensual ambiance of the song draws the listener right in, with an ethereal, almost soothing feeling of being inside an idyll taking place. As KAI switches to a higher register, the emotions conveyed match the song's charming and well-thought-out lyricism. The track's repetitive hook is nothing but addicting, as the built-up adlibs and skillful falsetto soften it out and help build a solid piece that gracefully gains more likability the more you listen to it. Although Peaches is only KAI's second project as a soloist, ""Vanilla"" demonstrates the performer's vast experience within the music industry, as he confidently created a track that can go along with the album's dreamy concept but can also stand out on its own.. . —loveholic""Zombie"" - PURPLE KISSOriginal Song | Romanization | English Translation. From Dosie’s first “bie-bie-bie” there is no getting away from this infectious earworm. Purple Kiss’ first comeback after their debut in March of this year manifested them further as a promising artist to keep an eye on. “Zombie” is an electronic dance-pop track with a pushing beat and just the right amount of smart ideas to be interesting and clever instead of overladen. Like the little adlib at the end of the song’s intro or the electric guitar riff that bridges the gap between verses and chorus. A very charming idea was also the aegyo added to the line delivery of “아이 깜짝이야!” by Ireh and Jieun. This cute brightness is woven through the whole song and is one of the reasons that make it such a continuously pleasurable listen. Visually the juxtaposition of the rotting undead and the mood of the song is perfectly translated into a bright and colorful music video which includes neon green brains and a hungry mob chasing the members until nothing but Dosie’s skeleton remains. Very aptly called bubblegum horror by a friend of mine, “Zombie” is an all-around fun time that makes you want to listen to the song again and again or learn that cool zombie movie from the choreography.. . —sianii1Embed",INTP

You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope. I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old. . [Pre-Chorus]. You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise. You're spilling like an overflowin' sink. You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece. And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink. [Chorus]. Everything is blue.

368,368,John Mayer - Save Room,"Dizaster vs. Cassidy (Part 2) Lyrics[Round 1: Dizaster]. Yo that shit you did last night was fucking gay!. But regardless lets get this battle underway. Because I'd rather get buried alive. Than have to deal with a piece of shit like you for another day. This battle is like the Alpha versus the Omega. Yeah you the start of it all. But I have evolved and became far greater. I am like Michael Angelo the archangel. If he was a dark natured art painter. Painting a picture of heart failure. Look at the all the trash In your iPod player. Running in circles on these tracks. Only to roll in a cage and you crashed like a NASCAR racer. I'm a gargantuan Hall Of Famer. On stage with a ball of chain, a barbarian on paper. Every bars tailored for your Paul Bearer. Allahu Akbar, a battling rap god slash bar maker. Bar Mitzvah glass jaw breaker. Large tray full of shots like a bar waiter. Kamehameha, bar layer after bar layer. The chicken getting plucked if I pick 'em. I'm a guitar player like John Mayer. Fuck a long saber like.. I ain't Luke Skywalker I'm Darth Vader. Armed with Vegas' claw blade may god save em -like Bart's neighbors. Stop hating you all haters. Open your dome before that long scope. Put your face in the stars like Carl Sagan. Walking around cross faded giving you those raw hay makers. You gon get bars straight from this foreigners phone like jail breaker. I get rid of your bars like bail bondsman. Since you don’t wanna sit in the yard and do hard labor. Got your memory scarred but you gon' remember this all later. Don’t worry at all player. Its all saved on your Sega memory card data. Along with the rest of your outdated Raps. Next to your packs of Garcia Vega Cigar Papers. If I catch your mama joggin' in cross trainers. I'ma go across her face with a Mach razor. Then walk away from her cause I'm a heart breaker. This ain't an arcade or a game at all crossing me on an off day is like. Tossing a piece of large bait to jaws you getting Shark-Kesha'd. A grave robber, robbin' bodies for Al Qaeda. Still surround you with so much Watts around you. You gon' feel like you got tasered. Hear a blast and see a flash from far like a massive star quasar. Laser hit you in your facial tissue like acne scar laser. For that white powder. A deuce deuce will leave little holes in your top like salt shaker. Then I'll finish it off with a big cap on your head like a park ranger. And if I don’t got it with me on DECK your gettin CUT like a Las Vegas' card player. And I ain't playing with you at all bitch, I ain't a dog trainer. Man you hell of a pussy for the shit you did last night. I could tell you nervous right now by how you moving your hands right. Yeah please don’t fuck with me. You already know what's up with me. You brought all your homies with you because you didn’t do it without your company. Scarface.. fuck you gon do now?. Oh, oh he can't battle without your mothafuckin' crew now. Yeah, exactly you cannot match me. You had wack punchlines wheelchairs in Degrassi. Fuck do you mean dawg?. Ever since that mothafuckin car hit you. Somethin' been wrong with you. You been a bit {whistle} off tempo ever since you popped out of the coma you dropped into. Bars no longer hard hittin' he's all filler after the doc stitched you. You went from artistic to autistic. Mentally challenged and part crippled. From all the brain damage and scar tissue. That caused him to suffer so much permanent memory loss that you don’t know whether or not something is wrong with you. And I left that part open to symbolize how you completely forgot who you are the moment that car hit you. Amnesia is a motherfucker.... And at this current rate he wake up everyday in the same reoccurring state. Where he look in the mirror and doesn’t recognize the person he face. Feels so disturbed from it he feels like the person that's facin' him is violating his personal space. He's a groundhog that’s why he wakes up and writes the same verse everyday. It's like every part of his memory that’s short term was erased. I feel bad for your wife because she probably feels like. Shes fucking the bitch Adam Sandler was fuckin' in the first 50 Dates. That’s kind of a low blow I shouldn’t have made fun of that car crash. That was some hard shit to live through. But I chalked it up to bad karma. See most people don’t believe in karma anymore but obviously I still do. Cause for instance you got famous for killin' a Freeway then a couple of years later. You got famous again when a freeway almost killed you. Don't ask me to give a fuck I ran out of fucks to give. I hope you get in another car accident. This time with your baby mother and kid and instead of dying you end up being the only one of them that lives. What?. Yeah that was a low blow. I know doe doe. Take a photo oh. I'm 'bout to roll up and pop [?] to his fo’ do. Oh no, he's probably gonna go and PC again and talk to the po po. How you gon talk shit about Meek Mill you’ve been a Dream Chaser. Fell the fuck off the scene and become a free baser. Ill put five to the side of your car like Speed Racer. Then have you run away car explodin' in the background like the cover of Peacemaker. Yeah you could act up you get slashed up and hacked up left on your back stretched cutty. I'll fuck your ass up. I'll stab you into the past tense buddy. You ain't survivin' this crash. The impact will pry you in half. Fly through the glass as the dash gets bloody. Cass' take your last breath cause you gon' catch wreck faster than the crash test dummy. Big Daddy Kane told me No Half Steppin'. You half step it’s a wrap. You getting wrapped up like an Aztec mummy. Yo you know why this dude Cass' act real funny?. I don’t know cause he talks about his battle with Freeway like the four touchdowns he scored back in high school you the black Al Bundy. Y'all wanna know another reason why Cass' acts real funny?. I don’t know he claims he gettin' bitches and he pimpin'. But really he Married With Children cause he like the black Al Bundy. Y'all wanna know another reason why he act real funny?. I don’t know because he had a hit but after the show was over him and Kelly went separate ways.... You the black Al Bundy. [Round 1: Cassidy]. Listen man, I'm feeling real upset today. Cause I heard you paid some niggas from Grape Street to fuck up our battle yesterday. And that was extra gay. You took the bitch ass route. Scared that I was gonna fly Math out here to knock ya bitch ass out. I bare arms grizzly style, and if I'm hungry for the chicken. That heat'll spin you around rotisserie style. You was rich as a child, never wanted for shit. And you ain't never run the strip, you just running your lips. I know you wish you had a shorter nose. I wish your mom had a miscarriage and you was born in a toilet bowl. Or your dad splashed you right on your mama face. Cause you like a hermaphrodite, a dickhead with a Regina face. The nose, the clit, your mouth is the pussy hole. So don't get the lips on your pussy swole playin' that pussy role. I got bars like phone car reception. But stay strapped like back packs, gat black, Biggie Smalls complexion. You Ready To Die? That .38 special lead like special ed. It'll teach you retards a lesson. I grip that thing and I'm aiming in y'all direction. Hit ya abdomen and strangle your man and 'em with your small intestines. I'm what you call a veteran, I'm legendary. And you just a son of a bitch and it's hereditary. If I was Math, you'd be dead already. Your picture on a obituary, bullet holes in your head already. I'm 5000 and 0, my record dumb nigga, dumb nigga. You lost more battles than you won nigga. I ain't never lost one nigga. You playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun nigga. And where the fuck is you from nigga. Iran, Pakistan or Lebanon?. Never mind, I don't give a shit you fucking immigrant. I hope you green card get revoked you fuckin' degenerate. Explain this shit, you freestyle for free on some beginner shit. With the pen I'm sick, penmanship, I get paid to spit. And you ain't gettin' paid shit. If you add up all the money that you made from every battle that you ever had. That wouldn't even be half of what I'm getting paid for this. You make me sick, your rap style awkward as hell. You act all wild and rap loud. You think your bars sound hard cause you yell?. And you was in a group called Krack City. But never sold no crack in your city, that's retarded as hell. Ayo this kid a clown. I want y'all to hear my impersonation of how corny this nigga sound. {Impersonating Dizaster}. I'm authentic, my brain is large, augmented. My car rented, it's cause your Swisher switching cigar scented. I'm barbaric with bars but never bartended. Yo I go hard wit it, spitting poison, I'm arsenic. You could get punished you could get it if you want it. Your stomach I'll carve into it, then poke it open and barf in it. I'll cum in your moms box and let my cock spar with it. Put something hard in it, go hard in it. Then pull out then stick my whole arm in it. Pull out her cervix and then tell her to suck my dick. That's how you really fuck a bitch. Look at his eyebrows this nigga hostile. Like, ""Damn that man sound better than me with my style."". I had to mimic how your style sound. To prove I can shit on you with any style. I'm moving my bows now, I'm the king bow down. And next time you get a cut, make the barber trim the eyebrows down. My fans like, ""Cass' you the best."". Damn right I was battling before the cameras and the damn mics. Before Facebook, before Twitter and Instagram lights. Worldstar, Vlad, Youtube and all' em damn sites. I ain't battled in 12 years but I'm so damn nice. I hand write raps that's crack Klu Klux Klan white. Yes your ass an A-Rab, but you not the Taliban type. Cause you ain't never pop off a chopper your whole damn life. Plus you an Atheist who don't believe that God exist. You went from Allahu Akbar to a Scientologist. You a homo, so I understand why you switch. Cause Islam don't accepts faggots that like ridin' dick. And how you Grape Street, fruit cup?. You wouldn't bust a grape in a food fight. Banana clips'll crack your coconut. The toast will bust, remove everything from your shoulders up. Listen ya head missin', the coffin can't open up. You chokin' up like an asthmatic that smoke too much. Dawg you like a K-9 cop, sniff coke too much. I'm like shootin. Up in a vein and my dick dope as fuck. My bars raw and all of your bars is baking soda'd up. Like having sex with a fractured pelvis you broke us fuck. You [?] and got no chicken; veggie store. I have four dollars and flip that. Bought a soda, two Dutches, some chips and a Kit Kat. Nah forget that, I got a quarter mill to kill this cat. Bought an M4, two K's and some Macs all big gats. Then I went to see my connect like, ""Where the bricks at?"". He made me spend, I paid for ten, but brought twenty bricks back. Then I brought my chick back a Khloe and the Fendi. And used twenty grand worth of benji for the gift wrap. Me against this bitch is a mismatch. Cause every line I rhyme is a punch. But I could beat him with bitch smacks. [Round 2: Dizaster]. Alright look man you called me an immigrant. Pfft you wanna call me a Arab?. Talk shit about that, well that’s some shit I do not understand. Hell yeah I’m a immigrant. I’m Palestinian cause if shit is real (Israel) I don’t gotta sling shots. You could get rocked with these hands. Do you understand?. That you wack and I hate the way that you act. You always talk shit about people and reference how they’re gay when they rap. But you’ve been accused of having AIDS it don’t get gayer than that. You said I’m a atheist I’m not dawg that's a fucking lie. It don’t mean I don’t believe in something just cause I don’t believe that there's an invisible man that whispers to me in the sky. You might be a little ridiculous, cause back in the days. Hold on let me tell you a story from way back. Way back before Daylyt got his face tat. When all you had was your fucking five XL white T’s with your dirty wave cap. You used to rap about how you blaze gats and slang packs until you caught a case fast. You went to jail then came back. You changed paths you went from sprayin' caps. To Christian faith raps you're a hypocrite I hate that. Cause now you back to the same Cass' that gangsta Cass' that I bang Cass'. Once again you came back after Jesus saved yo' fake ass. So this ain't even a welcome home party for you. This is technically like welcoming Ma$e back. Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back, Pastor Faggot. And now hes back and he's gat holdin'. What a bad omen. He got locked up and found God and came out as a black Mormon. This motherfucker reminds me of Dragonball. Cause as soon as he got in a cell he started transformin'. He don’t understand whats happening here. He likes to whisper in mans ear. This cat's a fuckin' bitch when he's performin'. Look how you went like Notorious BIG how you turned to Faith. But you ain't never gon get into Heaven with that dirty face. I'm pretty sure one of the main requirements to get through the pearly gates. Is not bragging about havin a murder case. But you forgivin'...you forgiven tho. He's a born again Christian virgin. Fuck his image I guess this fuckin' image isn’t workin'. What good is being religious when you're just a shitty person?. This fool went on the Breakfast Club and spit some Jesus raps and nobody was feelin' it. Soon as he left the radio station Charlemagne was lookin at the co-host like, ""Damn. What a fuckin idiot."". What you need to do is stop claiming you're a killer when you a Christian cause it makes you sound like an idiot. You need to tell these people, who you really is. That Philly kid, who got famous for claimin' a murder that he never really did. Yeah tell these people all the facts here really. How you ran your mouth and almost got smacked by Gilly. How your man caught a body for you. You left him starving and that’s why you can't come back to Philly. Tell these people how you no longer a Philadelphia boy. Tell these people how you moved out and you a New Jersey resident boy. Them OG’s on the block are like Japanese chefs. Cause soon as they smell something fishy. You got cut that’s how people in Philadelphia roll. What now you got Bloods you payin' to protect you. Cause you ain't nothing but a clown. What you should do is take that money and give it to OBH cause they the ones that held you down. Maybe if you woulda taken care of Ab, you wouldn’t have been ran out of your fuckin' town. Can't come back to his pack in Philly, cause to be blunt ever since he got cut, he ain't had the guts to stick around. I spoke to your OG's, Mr. Majors, AR-AB, I’ve been talkin to all of them they told me. All them cats from OBH, you phony. You never sold drugs, them coke deals are fictional stories. The only time you push keys is when you use them to lock the door on your homies. How could anyone call you loyal? Your own block disowned you. Your man caught a body you were in the crib cryin'. He outside putting his life and catchin, poppin' for you. What, What oh that ain't true? That ain't true?. Then why you fuckin talkin during the verse. Why you reacting to it. Cause you know it's true shit. It's fuckin with you it's fuckin with your brain. You already know that’s the type of shit that. Starts fuckin with your mind starts fuckin with you insane. Starts poundin' in your cerebellum fuckin up your membranes. Please, please listen, cause you know you wasn’t honest. AR-AB you told him you would ride with him, but you broke the promise. You closed it I know you closed it regardless. You a fucked up manager Cass'. Real managers are supposed to open doors for their artists. Well when it was time to pull the fifth out you dropped your clip. And you dipped out. You were supposed to use the chopper but you like Julia Roberts. Cause you nothing but a bitch with a big mouth. He claims he killed so many rappers that he lost count. He has such a large amount of body bags that there’s bodies he forgot about. But correct me if I'm wrong Aak. You never even caught the body and the only body you’ve ever talked about. So since when did claiming someone else's body count as a body count?. You don’t bang heavy metal, last time you seen a Body Count on your hands was when Ice T put his first album out. You ain't a gangster you're a rapper Cass', fuck you talkin 'bout?. You was crying like a bitch when shots rung out. Them large cans had you hiding inside like Oscar The Grouch. Ever since Vlad aired your dirty laundry out. We know that you a backstabbing fag that would let his man starve on the couch. And when you was with double R. We never seen Styles, Jada, Sheek with you at yo' show rocking it out. So the shootout you was involved in. Was the only time you've ever had The Lox (locks) in the house. Listen, cause he wasn’t poppin in the war when shit popped off he walked off. And he blocked off the entrance door turned into Sonic The Hedgehog and he balled up on the bedroom floor. Why you actin' like you the one who popped his pistol for?. If everyone in this room was a mutant from X-Men, you'd be Mystique. I mean you obviously that bitch of course. Cause you the only one in here comfortable enough with his own skin to walk around claimin' a body that isn’t yours. Fuck what you have to rap about, that's real shit. . [Round 2: Cassidy]. You looking petrified right now. I can tell its intimidation. I been knew your bitch ass was texting AR. Tryna find out a whole lot of information. But every time you rap I hear the crowd whispering. Like I ain't tryna hear this shit again, I'm tryna hear Cass spit again. My women friend? Bad Boy It's All About The Benjamins. You bend your men over then stick it in, bitch you feminine. You think cause you sucka punch Math, that niggas fear you?. Didn't you say you sucka punch Math cause that nigga dared you. Well I dare you, I fucking dare you. I double dare you, I triple dawg dare you. You try it, my dawgs'll air you. Him, him, them and every nigga standin' near you. Cause I'll even hit innocent bystanders. I dare you, I had to repeat it just to prepare you. To die or be a paraplegic, wheelchair you. Cause when gats clapping your back cracking, chiropractors. And I know you not 'bout to Showout. Cause I'll get my Hitman to Holla at you. (And I'll knock him the fuck out!). (I'll knock him the fuck out). You know what's up boy, you know you knocked out. You do not wanna box boy. Everybody know that you a fuck boy. And everybody know you like to fuck boys, that ain't even a mystery. I always got a pretty bitch with me. My bitch'll be like, ""Come and get with me. Pretty please, I need some dick in me."". I get bad hoes and you get dick in your asshole. You tryna hide it, you need to come out the closet. No I ain't homophobic, but nigga I'm gon' expose it. Stop it, Dizaster you sweet. When I rap, I rap for the streets. And you...rap for the suburbs like this, rapping too much words. You can't even rap to the beat. Dawg I've been had plaques on the wall and all you got is plaque on your teeth. If you and me happen to beef. I'll catch you at the red light. The shotgun, shotgun in the passenger seat. You would wet your pants begging for a second chance. I'm blastin' the heat, I don't sympathize. You'll get sent to God, Pimp Your Ride. Give you all red interior. It'll be an exhibit (Xzibit) of a natural Dizaster after they bury ya. This like a dog fight, but I'm superior. You like a Labrador and I'm more like Pitbull Terrier. A show stopper, flow hotter than Nigeria. So chicks like me, wrist icey like Siberia. I just bought a gold watch, with those rocks. Yellow like the bumble bee on a Cheerios box. So I wear it everywhere now, cause its exclusive. It look like my watch and Medusa just had a stare down. So hoes be pulling they underwear down. And start finger popping their damn Regina. Then hop on this Anaconda. I put it on my grandmama grave, I'm a grinder. I got insomnia. I don't need no damn pajamas, no sleeping. I'm up early for the cake, so I'm eatin'. But listen, what I'm whippin in the kitchen ain't Aunt Jemima. You gotta have a steady hand when you blam the Llama. Cause the 5th'll kick and it could sprain your frickin' wrist. The fiends know, I seen more snow than Saint Nicholas. The night before Christmas, my flip game ridiculous. And I pitched the zips of cocaine cousin?. Cause a lot of niggas fuckin wit Molly, that bitch promiscuous. I gain support cause I'm a flamin' torch. Yep I'm heap, but fuck a beat. I don't need no track for my train of thought. For the dollar signs, I sign my name on the dotted line. Shit, I'm in my bag, try me, it's colostomy time. You need to transform, Optimus Prime. Cause you ain't got a dime, you still livin with your pop and your mom. In your room under the covers on your bed. Tryna cover your ear so you won't here your pop poppin' your mom. I'm the hustla, you not on your grind. So you couldn't walk in my shoes even if we wore the same size shoes. I been a fly dude, screw more chicks than niggas get their whole life. In my first semester in high school. That's why at school I did it big, Humpty Hump nose. Done lie, in school you got punched and got your lunch stole. I been official, this nigga got mental issues. You must've got dropped on year head at a couple months old. You've been retarded since an infant. So I swear I'm about to air you out like a car tire when the rim bent. You can't front chump. I got so many punches and bars after this battle you gon be punch drunk. They put an Arabian nerd from the Suburbs. Tryna have a nigga swag up against Mr. Cass?. My bars goes over niggas heads like a mistletoe. So you can kiss my ass if you think this nigga sick as Cass. This nigga trash. And you wanna know what else rhyme with trash Dizaster?. Ya cab-dispatcher. A swagless rapper. Arabic bachelor. That fuck with boys on the low like a Catholic pastor. . [Round 3: Dizaster]. Your a hell of a fucking weirdo bro. You said I got dropped on my head a couple of months old. No, but you got dropped on your fucking head a couple of years ago. It's one thing to be confident. Its another thing to have blind folded cockiness. See all you do is be coming off in blogs and be talking shit sounding like a retarded gimp. Coming off like Erykah Badu. Cause at one time you use to have Common Sense. I mean whats wrong with you dawg. Nowadays you like the boy who cried wolf tickets. Tryna provoke me with false threats. Cause I guess that's what you gotta do when you have a Napoleon Complex. You ain't a gangsta, you an actor performing his role while his on set. Part of this big ass metaphoric context. See you, stop frontin' like a soldier and you really want combat. Before you get shot and sent home with only one arm like a former Vietnam vet. You ain't from the army you don't pop TECs. That's an invisible cloak, an image that's not really there. You were never seen in the Philadelphia projects. Hold on, I sense a force field coming. The same people that said I wouldn't beat you. Are the same people that said Hollow wouldn't kill Budden. Say you gangsta then go peel something. AB told me you wasn't on the field four fifths gunnin'. You was clicking both hills running, you a fucking oatmeal muffin. You don't hold steal, and even if you did, you still won't kill nothin'. But blunt trauma force concussion. Get your whole grill crushed in. Crawling out of the Oldsmobile looking like roadkill. I got no chill button. Cassidy the hustler back on the block doing phone bill numbers. Carmelo gave him a million dollars he fucked it off. And ended up broke still and got no deal from it. Always sitting talkin' about how he chopped a whole big onion. Running your mouth about all these coke deals frontin. What coke deals?. It's like been at the poker table. Cause I know you're bluffin, but you ain't the player. You the house keeper when they hear folks cussin'. Cause you already know that you won't deal nothing. Such a fucking mark. Tryna play those type of games. Dawg I'm a fucking light you up cause my game type insane. With these bars I crafted, it's like a complex art. My thoughts are graphic. Imagine a collage full of visual bars from Leonardo's hand. Which makes it harder to brush me off once I start to draw you this canvas. A blank rap sheet. Full of post-dramatic flashes from car crashes. And you might've cruised through a Philly Freeway. But right now your in Los Angeles and you caught up in traffic. You can't be calling out rappers like Marshal Mathers. When all you have is nursery bars. Let me show you what a strong vocab is. You holographic, monosyllabic, robotic and bland. Monotone having ass, retarded sub par washed up mediocre four bar patterns. Brought an armed body guard that walked into the dress con' with him like Kevin Costner. Cause that's how much of a fraud his ass is. Yep. He had a Bounty guard him from getting washed. That's the reason you softer than cotton fabric softner. And we ain't cut from the same cloth that Cass is. Yeah I seen you, all up on those blogs with Vlad. Talkin', runnin' your mouth with your fucking bobble head fuckin Bob Saget retarded glasses. His fucking Bob Saget fucking goggle glasses. Running his mouth like a socially awkward ass off brand bubble head looking retarded faggot. Lets talk about how Jim Jones snapped on you. And AB had to step in cause you almost got yo' ass whipped. Or how when you saw the body, you started to panic. That's when your boys pulled your card like magic. Cause you were suppose to aim the thang, but you turned David Blaine. Soon as you saw someone in a box. You completely disappeared from the spot and vanished. Cause that gangsta role is just an act, you ain't problematic. You just a fake animated character with a real person riding on your side like Roger Rabbit. Yeah you put on some classics, like been on an R Kelly song and...that's it. Yeah its pretty cool, alright but that was hot. But when you go from that to lyin' 'bout been sponsored by a condom packet. It's safe to say your career's suffered a lot of damage. Especially when you go from the top hundred charts to the bottom bracket. And land in the same catalog as Math Hoffa's garbage track. That's along with every other lost New York rapper that ever put out a song on DatPiff. But his team always reaching for the highest amount of green. Look at their long giraffe necks. You went ya whole life talking about the gwap and crossing assets. You went ya whole life chasing that chunk of ice. Til you finally found it and became your downfall, you are the Titanic. Cause after you fell off your pendant got jacked bitch. You know the pendant from Jack's bitch. You fucking wack bitch. It's still 14-19 seconds, why you tryin' to act bitch?. Why you talkin' through my shit?. . [Cassidy]. I ain't talkin', I'm just...laughin'. . [Dizaster]. You said in a blog that you're the one who started battle rap. And before that you smoked a bowl of crack and you dropped some acid. If you think you started SMACK, then you a Molly addict. I don't know what they got you on after the car crash. But you must've got a doctors pass for popping Xanax. Who the fuck brought this synthetic hero in. My bars are like Oxy tablets. I'll fucking catch you in the fucking hood. And pop up with a large tool like a car mechanic. Sparking at random objects like their target practice. Fuck around with that long assault rifle. With the Mag pulled, folding stock, with the mad grip long. Scope on it, wit the lens on it thicker than my grandma's glasses. {Diz gets time called on him}. . [Round 3: Cassidy]. I'm so official, I hold the pistol put my finger cross the trigger. And pop like father figures. I ain't trying to hear (hair) nothin'. That metal start choppin' like barber scissors. I'll snap and give you head shots like barber pictures. But not for the gram, the Glock in my hand. I'll put to your head and let that thing cut like barber clippers. But since the DA be chargin' niggas. You gotta have the right plan to shorten a niggas life span. You take a life man, you could get a life man. If a snitch sit right on the stand and be the prosecutor hype man. Lift his right hand and be in there pointin'. But I got bread, I'll put money on your head like a hair appointment. And nah we not gon call cops, we all pop. Scar shots give you bold spots like near the ointment. Now, who use Head & Shoulders when their hair dirty?. Alright, well I'll blow his head off his shoulders, do this nigga head dirty. That was a head scheme, some of y'all got it. But them bars when over some of y'all heads like hair cream. My wife nice, that's dick head mean. I'm not single but can make every single bitch in here cream. Cause I'm a freak, my wife freaky too. She my boo we will screw at least two bitches every week or two. Watch as I keep a few, Ice smoother the face. So bright It'll make you cover your face like you playing peek a boo. I got a Hawk and a Eagle too. That's why I let bullets fly and Smoke em on and Poke em on, Pikachu. Only that person that deceivable believe its true. When you say you clap gats, that's unbelievable. No one believing you, you never shot shit. I'll pop and make you shit on yourself, that's why I pop shit. I'm fly no cockpit. I throw birds with no feathers I cop in the park and counter clock whip. But you ain't never cop shit. How you got blocks on lock with no keys nigga, you gon need a locksmith. I'm on some get gwap shit. Your chicken low man (Lo Mein), doodle I'ma chew you -no chopsticks. I jot shit on some think out of the box shit. Look I got him shook on some Michael J. Fox shit. You a comedian actin' the fool. And was on the Total Slaughter show tryna sing on some Jamie Foxx shit. You lost to Daylyt, got dropped bitch. And was feeling bad, really mad, suicidal. On your Robin Williams bad, really sad, about to kill yourself. Don't know why you didn't. You should've took a dirt nap if you were tired of livin'. R.I.P. Obviously you lost hope cause you always broke but you could die for free. See life come with a price you never pay. So not committing suicide the worst mistake that you ever made. But now I'm choosing to help. I'm killin' you in this battle, since you ain't have the bars to do it yourself. How you soft then rapping hard, stop confusin' yourself. That ain't cool Lush.. why you set this up to get this dude crushed?. My tool bust, yeah I keep the heat. The only time you squeeze that thing and bust is when you beat your meat. What you tryna front for, I show up to your front door. Chubby Jag sent address in his last text. I'll mask up like Daylyt, broad daylight. With two K's like Kanye's wife that's Ray J height. Then I'll pop till every family member shot. Infra dot, shinning red like a break light, but I ain't finna stop. Car scheme, I take your life with my ice on. It's like I got the high beam head lights on. My wrist glow cause I get do like taekwon. Rap and sell off white. Smoke so much the inside of my car need fog lights. Clags of smoke coming out of the gat like exhaust pipe. I'll let the gun shoot and open up your sun roof. The ratchet drawn you the bastard I'm a blast it on. Then lean you on the side of the road with no hazards on. I'm tryna re-up when the crack is gone. For them oils I'll ride out, but see keys don't turn Dizaster on. It's traffic on the highway to hell. That's where Dizaster going. I'm on the road to riches speeding past, this easy cash. I'm known for spraying shit up, but I don't graffiti tag. Your Middle Eastern ass should take a laxative and then eat some glass. I'll eat you up then eat your food with my greedy ass. See I smashed Freeway the free way, I ain't need the cash. I had to do it to Free, but now I don't do it for free. To go through me you gotta pay, I ain't a easy pass. You sound wack to me when you rap. {Time gets called on Cassidy}3Embed",ENFJ

383,383,MLTR - That's why ,"The World as Self, Part 4: Self as Play LyricsSo when the Hindu and Buddhist philosophers speak of detachment from all this apparent world of separate beings—detachment means ‘going with’ this whole thing and not resisting its change. And you can afford to go with it, you can afford to get mixed up in life, and to fall in love, and to get involved with all sorts of things. You can afford it if you know that it’s an illusion. But this is not illusion in a bad sense of the word.. . Here’s this Hindu word—crucial—the world is called māyā. This word, māyā—yes, it means ‘illusion,’ it means ‘magic,’ it means ‘art,’ it means ‘delineation,’ or ‘measurement’—and so from matr we get ‘meter,’ and we also get ‘matter,’ ‘material.’ Isn’t it funny that the way we say ‘material’—today, we mean something very real, but the root of the word is ‘illusion.’ So, you see—I mean, measurement is kind of an illusion. You don’t find inches lying around; you can’t pick up an inch. So, in the same way that hours and inches and pounds and dollars and so on are actually imaginary—they’re elaborate systems of cosmic bookkeeping with their little scratches on paper, little hairlines on dials—so in exactly that way the distinction between things is māyā, is imaginary. But what an imagination! In a way, to say that the world is māyā is at the same time to say that what lies behind māyā is immaterial. Look at the reversal of the word. Oh, it’s immaterial, it doesn’t matter. What matters is all this.. . But that gets us to a deeper point yet. The Self—the real Self—doesn’t matter, which is another way of saying it doesn’t exist for any purpose. It doesn’t need to exist for any purpose. What purpose would it exist for, when it’s what there is! It won’t find anything in the future, has nothing in the past that it has to go back and remember. It’s now. An eternal now. And so, in that way it doesn’t matter. But therefore, the most important thing in the universe is the one thing that doesn’t matter. The one thing that’s totally and completely useless, and that nobody can find anything for.. . Once, a Zen master was asked, What is the most valuable thing in the world?. . And he answered, The head of a dead cat.. . Why?. Because no one can put a price on it.. . So this Self, the Brahman, is like the head of a dead cat. But you see, if, then, you say, Mmm, I really ought to get that dead cat’s head because... something spiritual about it and it’d be very good for me. After all, if I knew the Self I might be a better person. People might like me more. I’d be more constructive in society. I would do this, that, and the other. You see, that’s putting the cart before the horse. That’s trying to make the tail wag the dog.. . The knowledge of Brahman, the Self, never does anybody any good if they’re trying to make it do them some good. Only when they are not concerned with whether it does them any good or not does it do them any good. It’s like when you relax and you go out and play. Americans, in particular, don’t know how to do this because they always justify it. They always say, It’s good for me. It’s exercise. It’s just a change from work, and that’ll be able to make me work better. See? Everything they do is done for some serious reasons. It’s the Protestant conscience. And so we never play, except very exceptionally. Because play is that which is done just for itself—for fun.. . So the Self—the Ātman, the Brahman—exists for fun. See, there is no reason to exist; it’s completely useless. And it is—therefore, māyā is linked with the word līlā, and that means ‘play.’ Also, of course, the word ‘illusion,’ in English, is derived from the Latin ludere, ‘to play.’. . So the nature, you might say, of the Self is that it does no work, it only plays. Work is something serious, you now, that you do for a purpose because you believe that you’ve got to go on living; you work to survive, because you think you have to survive. That was one of the things they told you as a little child. You’ve got to go on, man!. . You don’t have to. This thing doesn’t have to go on—that’s why it does. I know that sounds paradoxical, but there’s so many things in life that are like that. If I’m trying to impress people I usually don’t. If you try too hard with anything you usually make a mess of it. And so this basic thing, then, is that the Self—the Brahman behind the world—is engaged in play. It is in this sense that the Hindu philosophers say, Brahman does not actually become the world. The meaning of that is: he’s playing at being it—or it’s playing at being it—as distinct from working at it.. . And so, in certain Oriental countries, when one refers to noble people of high birth it is often said, Lord So-and-so has died. The Japanese would say he’s played at dying. Or will he play at taking a journey to Tokyo? Also, remember this: although I have constantly used in this talk the word ‘one’ to apply to the Self—and ‘central’—the Hindus don’t use this word except speaking poetically and loosely. The Self is not one. The Self is called ‘non-dual’—because, you see, the idea of one has an opposite. The opposite of one is many—or none. But the which then which there is no whicher has no opposite; there’s nothing outside it, so you can’t call it ‘one.’ Because ‘one’ is an exclusive idea, it excludes ‘two.’ So they call it, instead of ‘one,’ they call it ‘non-dual,’ which is advaita. This is from the word, you see—dva is the root meaning ‘two;’ the ‘v’ becomes ‘u,’ so we get ‘dual;’ and ‘a’ is the meaning—in Sanskrit, often—‘non.’ Non-dual, advaita.. . And so it doesn’t exclude anything. ‘One’ is an exclusive word. Advaita is meant to be a totally inclusive kind of unity. Now, of course, this word itself—when you look at it from a logical standpoint—is a dualistic word, just like ‘one.’ It’s the opposite of dvaita. Dvaita and advaita. But the idea here, in Indian philosophy, is to use this word in a certain way. Now, you know that on a flat surface you can’t draw three dimensions. Anything you draw will be in two dimensions. But why do we see three dimensions? Because of an artistic convention called one-point perspective, which will give you the illusion of a third dimension.. . Now, in other words, a two-dimensional line is being used to imply a third dimension which can never be expressed on a flat surface. So, in exactly the same way, advaita is a word used specially to designate what lies beyond all logical categories.Embed",INTP

Would you tell me I was wrong?. Would you help me understand?. Are you lookin' down upon me?. Are you proud of who I am?. There's nothing I wouldn't do. To have just one more chance.

Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours. . [Verse 1: Jade, Jesy]. We keep behind closed doors. Every time I see you, I die a little more. Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls.

'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do. I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like. And she'll never know your story like I do. . [Pre-Chorus]. But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts. She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. [Chorus]. If you could see that I'm the one who understands you. Been here all along, so why can't you see?. You belong with me, you belong with me. . [Verse 2]. Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans. I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be. Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself. Hey, isn't this easy?. And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down. You say you're fine, I know you better than that. Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?. . [Pre-Chorus]. She wears high heels, I wear sneakers. She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers. Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find. That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. . [Chorus]. If you could see that I'm the one who understands you. Been here all along, so why can't you see?. You belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your back door. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me, you belong with me. [Bridge]. Oh, I remember you driving to my house. In the middle of the night. I'm the one who makes you laugh. When you know you're 'bout to cry. And I know your favorite songs. And you tell me 'bout your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. . [Chorus]. Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you. Been here all along, so why can't you see?. You belong with me. Standing by and waiting at your back door. All this time how could you not know, baby?. You belong with me, you belong with me. .

And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one. Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late. [Pre-Chorus: Khalid]. She used to meet me on the Eastside. In the city where the sun don't set. And every day, you know that we'd ride. Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette. Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight. We can go anywhere we want. Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea. Just take my hand and come with me, yeah. . [Chorus: Khalid]. We can do anything if we put our minds to it. Take your old life, then you put a line through it. My love is yours if you're willing to take it. Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it. So come away, starting today. Start a new life together in a different place. We know that love is how all these ideas came to be. So baby, run away with me. . [Verse 2: Halsey]. Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family. A house, and everything in between. And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three. And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously. We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay. Our old friends are now our enemies. And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young. Back to the day when I was falling in love. [Pre-Chorus: Halsey]. He used to meet me on the Eastside. In the city where the sun don't set. And every day, you know where we'd ride. Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette. And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight. We can go anywhere we want. Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea. Just take my hand and come with me, singing. . [Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]. We can do anything if we put our minds to it. Take your old life, then you put a line through it. My love is yours if you're willing to take it. Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it. So come away, starting today.

409,409,Isyana Sarasvati - Il Sogno,IL SOGNO Lyrics[Chorus]. Question every second when I'm dreaming. I feel it. Alive. Il Sogno. . [Verse 1]. Climbing to the top of Himalaya. I need to survive. All of the scenes they keep on playing. Running around in never ending motion. Is it a sign of what is coming. Either a gift or a burden. [Chorus]. Question every second when I’m dreaming. I feel it. Alive. Blinded by a mist under the moonlight. My vision. Revives. Il Sogno. . [Bridge]. Il Sogno sembra di essere sempre vivo. . [Instrumental]Embed,ENFJ

I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet. Went something like. [Refrain: Jesy]. Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo. Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo. . [Verse 2: Jesy, Leigh-Anne]. Every time we'd go dancing, I'd see his straying eyes. Gave him too many chances, pushed my gears too many times. Anyway, he'd start actin' up, and I'd be on my way to leave. But I stopped in my tracks when I heard this melody. And it went like. . [Refrain: Leigh-Anne, Leigh-Anne & Jade].

He played me, made me believe it was real love. Sang me sweet melodies. But the day he did me wrong. The song couldn't go on and on and on. [Verse 3: Perrie, Perrie & Leigh-Anne, Perrie & Jesy]. He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats. I was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet. Yes, when he came along, that's when I lost a groove. There was no song in the world to sing along or make me move. Sounded something like. . [Refrain: Jesy, Leigh-Anne, Perrie]. Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh). Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (It was). Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh). Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Oh). . [Chorus: All, Perrie, Jade, Jesy]. He used to sing me sweet melodies (Oh, woah).

You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?. I need rest now, got me bummed out. You so, you so, you. Baby, baby, babe. I've been on my empty mind shit. . [Pre-Chorus: SZA]. I try to keep from losin' the rest of me. I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe. You don't care. Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"". Tryna make sense of loose change. Got me a war in my mind. Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me. Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me. [Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]. All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile. Still wanna try, still believe in. Good days, good days, always. Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind). Good day living in my mind. . [Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]. Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations. I disappear if you let me. Feelin' like, yeah (On your own). Feelin' like Jericho. Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit. Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I. Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood. Know you like that shit. Can't groove it, ba-baby. Heavy on my empty mind shit. . [Pre-Chorus: SZA]. I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me). Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe. You don't care.

Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me. [Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]. All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile. Still wanna try, still believe in. Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind). Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind). Good day living in my mind. . [Verse 3: SZA]. Gotta get right. Tryna free my mind before the end of the world. I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text. I choose not to respond. I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened. Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present. (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na). Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now. . [Outro: Jacob Collier]. Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind. You've been making me feel like I'm. Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind172Embed",ESTJ

426,426,JJ Heller - Meant to be,Meant to be LyricsCoffee in the morning. Ice cream at night. Make sure the kitchen's clean. Then we turn out the light. Raindrops on the window. We're on the couch. Fire in the fireplace. Best seat in the house. . When God made you. He already knew. That we were meant to be. With love as deep. As the big blue sea. We were meant to be. Feet on the dashboard. Wind in my hair. As long as you're beside me. I'll go anywhere. I'll make you dinner. You do the laundry. We'll make mistakes. Then say we're sorry. Our love will bend. But it won't break. When we give more than we takeEmbed,ENFP

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?. Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?. Looking around here you think. ""Sure, she's got everything"". I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty. I've got whozits and whatzits galore. You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!. But who cares? No big deal, I want more. I wanna be where the people are. I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'. Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!. Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far. Legs are required for jumping, dancing. Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street. . Up where they walk, up where they run. Up where they stay all day in the sun. Wanderin' free - wish I could be. Part of that world. What would I give if I could live out of these waters?. What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?. Bet'cha on land they understand. Bet they don't reprimand their daughters. Bright young women sick of swimmin'. Ready to stand. . I'm ready to know what the people know. Ask 'em my questions and get some answers. What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?. When's it my turn?. Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?. Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that world15Embed",ENFP

You never been on land, and you never seen the sky. You don't know what a cloud is. Why does everything I love have to die?. They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be. But I couldn't let that be. By keeping you small, by keeping you safe. If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea. 'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank. [Chorus 1]. And Pablow the blowfish. I miss you so much. And Pablow the blowfish. I miss you so bad. . [Verse 2]. On Saturday night, we all went out to eat. But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi. I got soup, and I ordered rice. But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite. . [Chorus 2]. Oh, Pablow the blowfish. If they only knew you like I do. They'd love you too. And Pablow the blowfish. I miss you so bad. . [Verse 3]. I won't forget, even one second we had. 'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead. I heard of a seahorse named Sadie. I heard she was quite the lady. Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies. That'd be kind of crazy. [Bridge]. If Pablow the blowfish. Found love deep in the sea. Then that would mean. Pablow the blowfish. Is better off than here with me. . [Outro]. But Pablow the blowfish. I miss you so bad12Embed",ESFJ

476,476,The Jesus and Marry Chain - April Skies,"Angela’s Ashes LyricsAngela's Ashes. . A Memoir of a Childhood. . By Frank McCourt. . This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.. . Acknowledgments. . This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.. R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.. Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.. Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third. and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.. And Molly was right.. My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.. My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final. page.. I am blessed among men.. . I. My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.. When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.. People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.. Above all-we were wet.. Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.. From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.. The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.. Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the. rain.. My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County. Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.. When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.. Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.. After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.. My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.. After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?. Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.. He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles. a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.. Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.. She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.. Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.. My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.. My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.. St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.. Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.. And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.. Love her as in childhood. Though feeble, old and grey.. For you'll never miss a mother's love. Till she's buried beneath the clay.. At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.. She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.. With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.. A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.. That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.. Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.. Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.. Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.. Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.. Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.. Delia said, You shuddup.. Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.. Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.. Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.. And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.. Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little. talk.. Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.. Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than. you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.. Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.. You shuddup, said Delia.. Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd. manner.. Malachy smiled. I do?. about. You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.. 'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.. Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry. that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.. Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.. There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.. You shuddup, said Delia.. Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.. Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.. Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.. He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.. On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.. Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.. There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.. After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.. Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.. At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say. that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.. If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?. I am, Philomena.. A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.. The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.. Their husbands agreed.. I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.. Up, down, up, down.. Malachy goes up.. I get off.. Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is. on his mouth and there's blood.. Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.. And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly. slows her.. She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?. In the middle of the day?. She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.. My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside. the child?. did.. our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a. dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.. Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.. I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the. dog.. Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All. the same blood.. Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She. tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.. Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.. Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?. It was his time, Francis.. The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother. shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other. room.. My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white. enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.. Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?. Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story. when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.. I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a. different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?. Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.. That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.. He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.. For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.. Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.. In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.. I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.. When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.. She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.. I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.. I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam. says,. They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.. When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,. It had to be and the reason is this. Could it be true, someone like you. Could love me, love me?. When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.. When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is. say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.. When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.. All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.. Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.. But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,. From neither of them shall I part.. For one is my mother,. God bless her and love her,. The other is my sweetheart.. Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.. When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.. When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?. Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?. Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.. He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.. Deep in Canadian woods we met. From one bright island flown.. Great is the land we tread, but yet. Our hearts are with our own.. Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.. Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,. isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she. I want them up, he says. I want them. be free from the center to the sea.. Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.. a penny in your pocket without. says.. ready for the day Ireland will. do it'll be a sorry day in. He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?. Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.. On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.. Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?. He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he. says.. Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram. and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.. We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.. We wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.. When the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street. herself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?. She goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?. No, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.. We go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.. It's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.. The man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.. I'm looking for my father. Is my father here?. Naw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?. His name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.. Malarkey?. No, Malachy.. Malachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?. He calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy. Malachy what sings Kevin Barry?. Men shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin. Barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'. da woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.. The man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.. Mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.. Mam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.. When we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?. The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.. Oh, she says, I don't want much.. Anything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.. We have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.. I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.. The next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.. He takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.. We spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.. When he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.. We can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.. They don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.. Minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.. Clap hands, clap hands,. Till Daddy comes home,. For Daddy has money. And Mammy has none.. Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the. song.. and I. song.. That's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's. Minnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can. knows. sing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.. Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.. sings. When Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.. With scarlet cap and coat of green. A cruiskeen by his side.. 'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.. Oh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.. He walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.. The more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.. The twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.. Mam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.. Och, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.. My mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.. Minnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?. Everyone.. The twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.. We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.. If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?. The Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.. My mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.. That's what I'll say. A man.. Then the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.. I go to him.. You the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?. Yes, sir.. Heah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.. Right? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.. Thank you, sir.. Jeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?. My father told me to say thanks, sir.. Your father? Oh, well.. Dad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President. Roosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.. Where did you get that fruit?. The man.. What man?. The Italian man gave it to me.. Did you steal that fruit?. Malachy says, The man. The man. And what did you do to Freddie. Lovely woman. I don't know what we'd. And you had to attack poor Freddie.. gave Frankie the bag.. Leibowitz? His mother was here.. do without her and Minnie MacAdorey.. Malachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.. Dad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.. My mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.. But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?. I don't.. My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He. was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.. Och, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has. his own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?. Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.. What's Samson?. If you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?. The baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.. They're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.. Mrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.. She's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.. Sick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.. We sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.. Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.. Mrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.. Malachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.. Were on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.. Yes, Papa. Papa.. That's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my. father.. My mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still. early and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,. Och.. Mam says, Is she, is she sick?. Och, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.. My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.. Go for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.. We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.. I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.. Why is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?. I get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.. Dad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?. My father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.. Mam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.. The twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the. cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.. After we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?. She's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.. Malachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.. So, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.. After we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy. vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.. She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.. Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?. My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.. Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.. In the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?. I don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.. What's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?. Oh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.. She spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.. Leibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.. I wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.. Minnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.. I don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?. I don't know.. Minnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.. Malachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.. Minnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.. Here he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.. Mrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.. Two days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.. We will, Dad, we will.. All together we sing Kevin Barry,. On Mountjoy one Monday morning,. High upon the gallows tree,. Kevin Barry gave his young life. For the cause of liberty.. Just a lad of eighteen summers. Sure there's no one can deny. As he marched to death that morning. How he held his head on high.. There's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.. Och, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.. You can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.. I know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed. now like a dacent man.. Bed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and. night, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?. Of course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.. One more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.. Come on, boys. Sing.. Because he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green. He goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;. True to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;. Young Roddy McCorley goes to die. On the bridge at Toome today.. You'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?. We will, Dad.. And we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.. My brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the. table and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.. That night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at. him. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.. In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.. Most of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.. Minnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.. Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?. He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.. We get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.. The man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.. Mr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.. Two big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?. I'm four going on five.. You're not very big for your age, are you?. I don't know.. Is your mother here?. She's in the bed.. What is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the. day?. She's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your. mother.. They brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell. of this place. And who are these children?. Malachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see. how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.. Malachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.. The big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.. Good God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?. Malachy says, They're all shitty.. Delia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.. What's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.. The big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.. That's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.. They would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?. Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.. Not my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.. You needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.. You'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.. Mind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.. And Philomena has no answer for that.. Minnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.. I wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.. Delia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.. Mrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.. I remain your loving neice. Philomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha). Grandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.. The ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.. II. In a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.. Dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?. Cows, son.. What are cows, Dad?. Cows are cows, son.. We walked farther along the brightening road and there were other. creatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?. Sheep, son.. What are sheep, Dad?. My father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?. And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.. Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?. Dad said, Good morning, Father.. Father? I said. Dad, is that your father?. Mam said, Don't ask him any questions.. Dad said, No, no, this is a priest.. Malachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are. you going?. Dad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest. took us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.. At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.. We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.. Och, says Grandpa, you're here.. Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?. Malachy says, What's boxty?. Dad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.. Grandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all. the eggs you can hold.. We have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I. wake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.. What?. Under the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.. I want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.. Now Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.. In the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when. Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.. Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.. It's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.. Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.. Dad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.. Where would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?. Och, I could go on the dole, I suppose.. You can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?. Dad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.. You'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.. You're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.. Dad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.. After we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.. Malachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.. Is that right, Dad?. 'Tis.. Mam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on. top of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.. Soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.. Och, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.. When the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.. Your Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.. Dad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.. But Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.. Free, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.. A woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.. The woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.. Mr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.. Mr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.. Oh, it's the drink you want, is it?. One pint is hardly drink.. You'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a. pint, wouldn't you?. Walking never killed anyone.. I want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a. guard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.. Night falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.. They're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.. The man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.. At the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.. The guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.. The sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The. guard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.. Dad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.. ****. Dad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?. I tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.. Oh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.. Mam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?. Mam shakes her head, no.. Ah, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.. But Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.. All right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.. She goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.. Mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.. 'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.. Dad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.. The driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.. Mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.. And I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.. The driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?. Dad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.. Well, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.. The sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.. Dad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'. 'tis a rich man's foolishness.. Along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the. boys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.. There is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.. There is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.. Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.. Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.. Grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.. There aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.. Malachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.. Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to. ye.. She won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with. laughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.. Dad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's. sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.. Are you going to behave yourself?. Malachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad. never raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.. That night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.. Aunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?. She spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.. In the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?. When she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.. That day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.. The room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.. Dad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.. Then Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,. Oh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better. soon.. Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on. his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.. A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.. Dad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?. A cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.. He struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,. though I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.. He wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.. Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.. We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.. Mam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.. A few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.. Mam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?. My mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.. Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.. Leave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.. She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.. Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt. Aggie. Pa is. about. never looks at him.. telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,. Malachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?. Och, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.. I wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three. four of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.. It's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.. Later, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.. When he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.. Dad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles ""The Boys of Wexford. "" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.. Next day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.. Mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.. They all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.. The young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.. The woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your. loss.. Another woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?. Ah, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.. They can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?. I do, says Mam, but I don't have them.. Nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.. The worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.. Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?. A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?. Women raise their hands, I am. I am.. Well, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.. They're all gone, I told you.. But 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.. The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's. smoking?. Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to. the last ash.. Every puff you take, he starts.. I know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.. Is that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know. where I will.. What are you talking about?. I'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.. Mr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know. what we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.. other. Then, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?. He stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the. women. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.. What are you tittering about? he barks.. Oh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.. I'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind. him.. One by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out. she's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.. When Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.. He turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.. Mr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.. The other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.. The third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.. Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.. The women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.. Nora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.. She leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.. She says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?. No. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.. The woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.. I don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?. Ah, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?. Mrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.. That scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.. I'm sure it does, says Nora.. But my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.. I'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the. St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.. I try to be a good Catholic.. Try? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known. for having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.. Well, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here.... God bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?. Well, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.. If you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.. All right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.. God bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.. On the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.. You're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.. She drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de. Paul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.. Eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.. She gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.. What are we going to do now, Dad?. I don't know, son.. Ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal. along the road.. There, Dad, there's coal.. Och, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk. and eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.. If you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.. She gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.. The minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs. in.. Oonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.. Mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm. sorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each. side of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?. Ah, no, says Mam. An onion.. The woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?. Mam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.. True for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.. Mam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.. The woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.. Mam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.. I'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?. Ah, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.. Well, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.. Mam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.. Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?. I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.. I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.. Dad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.. Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.. Malachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.. She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.. Ah, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.. He tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.. The fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.. Soon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.. In the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.. Mam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.. When Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.. Ollie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.. Ollie, Ollie, I want Ollie.. He follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.. Grandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?. Oliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?. Wouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.. And who's minding ye?. I am.. And what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.. his name?. Have ye any. porridge here?. What's porridge? says Malachy.. Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is. porridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.. She picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.. Do you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.. Porridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a. little porridge.. And I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of. everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.. Jesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.. Grandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.. Malachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.. Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.. I think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.. Aw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?. And Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.. Grandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.. Aunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.. Pa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.. Malachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.. Grandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.. She puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.. ***. We followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.. But he kept looking out the window.. She told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.. Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.. Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to. Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.. She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.. Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.. He picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.. He tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.. Dad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.. A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?. There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.. Dad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.. He laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.. Dad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he. yells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.. The man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.. Dad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.. Uncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.. But Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.. Dad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.. Dad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.. Next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.. I did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.. The morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.. He wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.. There lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.. Sing, Oh, let man learn liberty. From crashing wind and lashing sea.. He stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.. Mam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.. She tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.. She struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.. He blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.. He staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.. Then he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.. ***. Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.. He tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.. On Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to. return on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?. Mam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.. The boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?. A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?. I tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.. The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.. Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.. He tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.. I'm a bad boy.. Now say, I'm a bad Yank.. I'm a bad Yank.. Malachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we. were cowboys and gangsters.. Is that what you did, Heffernan?. I was only jokin', sir.. No more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.. And you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night. and thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.. I won't, sir.. And if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.. There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're. late, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.. They hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.. They hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you. about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.. One master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is. the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.. Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.. Mr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.. If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit. you.. Even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or. the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.. Big boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.. It is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.. If the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.. I know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.. Dad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.. Malachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.. He sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.. Dad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.. ***. He died anyway.. Six months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning. and there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.. Grandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles. of stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that. night as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.. Dad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.. He helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.. Grandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.. At the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?. He's, he's, in the pub.. Of course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.. She tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.. Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.. That's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.. Now, son. Now, son.. Dad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?. Dad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.. Don't be a bad boy.. No.. The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.. Dad says, All right. We'll go.. They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.. The man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.. The man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.. The men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing ""The Road to Rasheen"" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing ""The Road to Rasheen, "" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?. Mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.. Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.. Uncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.. Oh, Pat, she says. Pat.. I can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.. I know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.. I'll lift him an' I won't be singin'""The Road to Rasheen."". I know you won't, Pat, Mam says.. Pat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.. Eugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.. Uncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his. face.. Aunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the. coffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.. I don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.. The horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.. Mam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.. Malachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.. At the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.. Do what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.. It's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.. Two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.. The man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.. Dad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.. We make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.. It's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.. The fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.. When we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.. Dad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.. Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home. the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.. III. Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.. We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.. Mam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.. It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.. Mam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?. Cleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.. And he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.. Mam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.. Dad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.. Oh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?. Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.. Och, what am I going to do? Dad says.. Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.. I can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.. Suit yourself, says Mam.. I will, says Dad.. This is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in. the lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.. If you haven't a penny. A ha'penny will do. And if you haven't a ha'penny. God bless you.. Boys tease the girls and call out,. May your mother have an accident. Abroad in the loo.. Mam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?. Dad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?. Bosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.. I ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.. When he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.. When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.. You wouldn't do that, Angela.. I would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.. Bed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll. only have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.. He goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.. And he smiles.. Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort..... Mam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in. Limerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.. No goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.. He tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.. Mam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.. No, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.. And what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.. And a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.. The butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.. I am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.. The butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.. Sure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.. I know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.. Mam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the. pig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?. One calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's. head?. No, I don't, Paddy.. Grab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.. And Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?. No, I don't, Christy.. The only part they don't ate is the oink.. After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone. can see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is. laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.. I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.. He's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.. On Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?. Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.. Mam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.. She says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.. It's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag. when Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.. He takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.. It takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.. We have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?. Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.. The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.. It's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.. There are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.. Mam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.. Dad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.. He says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.. He eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.. It's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.. The angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.. Malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.. Malachy wants to know what an affliction is.. Affliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.. I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.. Dad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the. spitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.. I want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.. So I find the seventh step by counting from the top.. The baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.. Mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.. Michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?. Upstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.. They want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.. They say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.. They say, Mother of God.. Mam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?. The men.. What men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.. They're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and. they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?. Dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.. Malachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.. Mam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.. When they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.. I have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.. Dad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?. Don't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?. And what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go. barefoot?. I'd rather fix the shoes they have.. The shoes they have are falling to pieces.. I can fix them, he says.. You can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.. He comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to. Mr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes. you're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.. There are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.. There are no hands.. He says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?. No, sir.. What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?. Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.. Now if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at. McCourt or his brother over their. will come out, boys?. The stick, sir.. The stick will sting, boys.. air, it will land on the backside. sneers. Where will it land, boys?. shoes the stick will come out. What. The ash plant will whistle through the. of the boy that jeers, the boy that. On the boy that jeers, sir.. And?. The boy that sneers, sir.. The boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber. tires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.. If I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.. I could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.. I sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.. I stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.. I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.. He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.. Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.. In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.. Easter is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.. Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.. At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.. But, Dad.. Shush, it's a mystery.. There's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they. tell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.. Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.. The cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.. Friday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.. Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this.... There isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.. Pop. She's in a good mood.. Sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.. The men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.. We have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?. The women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be. the saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.. The darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.. The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.. I know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.. He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.. He's pushing in our door and singing,. And if, when all a vigil keep,. The West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,. That Connacht lies in slumber deep,. But hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'. He calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?. She doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.. I want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.. Dad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,. stepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.. Michael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.. He stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.. Malachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.. And I tell him I don't want it, either.. Dad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his. pocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.. IV. The master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.. The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.. The master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.. It's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.. It's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a. rage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.. Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.. If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.. Mikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.. You can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.. The children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.. My father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?. Nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?. Are you sure, Mikey?. I am. I read it in a book.. He sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over. his First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.. Mikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.. What about James Cagney?. Never mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to. every little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.. Mikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.. He says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.. The master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.. Brendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?. The master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do. what you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?. I do.. I do what?. I do, sir.. He goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will. never know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?. 'Tis, sir.. Question Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.. What's henchmen, sir?. The master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.. Look at this specimen, he roars.. Question is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.. The master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,. sir.. The day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take. you to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?. That God will take me to His bosom, sir.. Go back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from. the far dark corner of a bog.. He sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells. Question to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.. what?. What will I do, boys?. Flog the boy, sir.. Till?. Till the blood spurts, sir.. Now, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery, sir.. And what is adultery, Clohessy?. Impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.. Good, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in. the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.. Paddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.. I think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.. Mr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.. The priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy. Communion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?. Extreme Unction, sir.. That's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.. He tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.. He tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?. We have, sir.. What have we done, boys?. Bared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.. And?. Mounted the scaffold singing, sir.. As if?. Embarking on a picnic, sir.. He says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a. martyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.. But it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember. this, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?. We are, sir.. And what's enough?. The gift of Faith, sir.. Good. Go home.. At night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the. lane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.. Cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.. Mikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.. I don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.. But now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about. Cuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.. I'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.. Dad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?. He does.. Would the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?. Och, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.. Dad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.. He's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.. Do not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.. Next morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?. I tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.. Dad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?. I tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.. But the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.. All right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?. 'Tis, Dad.. The day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to. hell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.. We kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.. I try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.. It's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.. The panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?. I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's. purse. I said a curse.. Yes, my child. Anything else?. I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.. Surely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by. certain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.. 'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.. How was that, my child?. She won him in a pissing contest.. There is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth. and he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?. Mikey Molloy, Father.. And where did he hear it?. He read it in a book, Father.. Ah, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?. I will, Father.. Are there any other sins, my child?. No, Father.. For your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a. special prayer for me.. I will. Father, was that the worst sin?. What do you mean?. Am I the worst of all the boys, Father?. No, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of. Contrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.. First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.. Get up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.. I ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.. They dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.. Come here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.. She spat twice on my head.. Grandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.. We ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.. It's on my tongue. I draw it back.. It stuck.. I had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's. voice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.. I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.. God was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.. When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.. Mam, can I go now and make The Collection?. She said, After you have a little breakfast.. No, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a. proper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.. We followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained. that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.. Go aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?. The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.. Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.. She dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.. A day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?. I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.. The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.. Ah... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.. Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?. He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?. He didn't say, Grandma.. Well, go back and ask him.. But, Grandma.... She pushed me back into the confessional.. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last. confession.. A minute! Are you the boy that was just here?. I am, Father.. What is it now?. My grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and. tell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.. I told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering. him again.. Don't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.. I asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.. Grandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.. Mam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.. No he's not.. Yes he is.. Grandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will. save his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.. She pulled her shawl around her and walked away.. Mam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll. never see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.. We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?. I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.. What's a diversion?. I have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.. Mam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.. Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.. V. Grandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.. That's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.. Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.. People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.. In every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.. It's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.. They say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.. Mam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.. Mam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?. What poem, Angela?. 'Tis called ""The Man from the North. "" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.. I never heard that poem. Say it for me.. Mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.. And I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.. Oh, Garryowen may be more gay. Than this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down. On the river that runs through my native town.. But there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide. And Limerick town has no happier hearth. Than mine has been with my man from the North.. I wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.. She always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.. If he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.. Bridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.. Grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.. Uncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.. Uncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two. meals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.. Grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.. Bill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.. Uncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.. Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.. Grandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.. Every morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?. Mam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.. I don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.. You're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your. pals.. Grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be. meandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants. it.. There's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and. cabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.. It's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.. The second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.. What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was. attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.. Oh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.. She'll kill me.. Tell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.. Grandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.. He wants more dinner.. What do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?. He's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?. He says send him any class of a dinner.. I will not. I sent him his dinner.. He didn't get it.. He didn't? Why not?. I ate it.. What?. I was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.. She gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She. screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.. Take these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.. Of course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.. Every day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.. Mam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.. There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an. American and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.. When the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.. The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?. The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?. Dad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.. The doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.. The tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.. Next day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.. On a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.. Dance? Why?. You're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.. She tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.. What's ancestors?. Never mind, she says, you're going to dance.. I wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for. Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.. Mam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.. Cyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.. Mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.. If my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.. My uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.. There's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?. We do, Mrs. O'Connor.. Mam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.. Ah, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.. She waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with. kinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.. I don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.. Maura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.. Mrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.. Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.. Mam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good. laugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.. I don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.. They turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.. Mam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.. The fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.. He waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.. I tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.. Dad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did ""The Siege of Ennis"" and ""The Walls of Limerick, "" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called ""The Siege of Dingle""but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.. Next week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.. I have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned ""The Walls of Cork"" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, ""Walls o' Cork, "" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?. I can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.. Dad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.. The priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.. I'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.. Mam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.. Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.. Oh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.. Mam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.. Bridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.. Bridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?. And they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.. 'Tis.. Question Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.. Question says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.. Everyone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.. Our Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.. The Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing ""I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, "" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.. The prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.. The worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane. and roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.. The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?. I do, Declan.. Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.. Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.. Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.. Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.. He says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.. Every evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.. The Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to. the other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.. In a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.. Dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.. Stephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.. Dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?. There's no room for him.. Oh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.. Och, aye.. Oh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?. Och, he might grow up to be a priest.. I ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.. VI. Mr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with. a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.. Brendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?. We expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?. Brendan Quigley, sir.. This is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?. Far, sir.. Indeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the. grace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?. Up, sir.. Without Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.. Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.. Dotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?. Clohessy, sir.. Ah, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.. Paddy what?. Paddy, sir.. And what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we. down on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.. I'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in. What do I see, boys?. The lie, sir.. And what is the lie doing, boys?. Festering, sir.. Where, boys, where?. In his teeth, sir.. Euclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.. Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you. should get. your teeth.. know what a. Greek is?. Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.. Dotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model. himself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.. We listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.. Next day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?. The little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.. He lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?. Grace, sir.. And?. Beauty, sir.. And?. Elegance, sir.. Euclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you. understand that, boys?. We do, sir.. I doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.. He opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.. Paddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your. name?. Clohessy, sir.. What class are you in?. Fourth class, sir.. Now tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about. Euclid?. He is, sir.. And what is he saying?. He's saying he's a Greek.. Of course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.. Ah. Now is he drawing anything on the board?. He's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they. land on God's shoulders.. Mother o' God.. No, sir. God's shoulders.. I know, you idiot. Go home.. The next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.. Well, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.. Mr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.. You have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.. I'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.. Mr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?. It is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.. There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.. He peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.. Clohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?. I don't, sir.. It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun. is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.. Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.. He pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?. Every hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.. Then he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?. Mulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.. And what are you, Mulcahy?. An omadhaun, sir.. Fintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.. Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.. Of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.. The apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve. heights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?. You did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.. Why, Fintan?. They're my friends, sir.. The boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I. feel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.. Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.. The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.. After school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.. Paddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.. Fintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.. Don't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.. Ah, no, Fintan.. Ah, do, Francis.. All right, Fintan.. Fintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred. Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.. There's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?. The fourth of October.. That's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.. Mrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.. Fintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.. We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.. Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.. Paddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?. He is, Paddy.. The way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?. 'Tis, Paddy.. A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?. Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.. Boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the. hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.. Paddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.. It's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.. Fintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.. I'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.. Paddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.. Oh, Patrick.. Oh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.. Fintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard. in Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.. There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.. I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.. It's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.. We're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.. The rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.. What's that dot for, Paddy?. It shows they're high class, the quality.. But, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?. Course they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.. Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?. Naw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.. And I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.. Question Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.. Oh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.. My mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.. I could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.. We throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.. Paddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.. It's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.. There's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?. 'Tis, Mammy.. I'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?. I didn't.. Well, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small. fireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.. She finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.. Mr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.. And what's your mother's name?. Angela, Mr. Clohessy.. Ah, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?. 'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.. He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.. Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?. Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy.. Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.. Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.. I can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.. No good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.. My shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.. Frankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.. I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.. Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.. Paddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my. other shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.. I will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.. You could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.. If they were to get it they'd have it be now.. The fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.. It's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.. I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.. There's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more. important question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,. ha.. Michael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,. Frankie.. She says, Where were you all night?. I was here.. You had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick. looking for you.. Mr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?. It's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.. God above, is that Angela?. 'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.. He struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you. come in, Angela. Don't you know me?. Mam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out. who is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.. 'Tis, Angela.. Ah, no.. I know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I. remember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.. My mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.. We could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.. He has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?. I am, Guard.. Don't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.. I won't, Guard. I won't torment her.. He leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.. Mr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?. 'Tis, Dennis.. The doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.. Mam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.. I have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.. Before you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?. I will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.. Would you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?. That's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.. Ah, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.. Mam says, All right. I'll try.. Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.. When the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.. She stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.. Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.. Mr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.. God bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.. 'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.. Quiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother. was.. Mam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.. I know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a. bit strange?. Ah, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The. father is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.. We walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.. She lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.. She comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.. I'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.. VII. There are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the. call comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, ""The West's Asleep, "". ""O'Donnell Abu, "". ""The Boys of Wexford. "" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.. It's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.. I'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.. But this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.. What's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?. Well, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.. Who could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and. St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.. One of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.. My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?. We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.. She yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?. No.. But, Mickey, you promised.... She slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till. Billy Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.. One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.. Proddy Woddy ring the bell,. Not for heaven but for hell.. On Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?. He says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?. Grandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.. But he's only nine and still in school.. School. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.. He has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.. Never mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.. I meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.. We make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?. Uncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?. No, Uncle Pa.. You're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?. Grandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.. Come on, 'tis gettin' dark.. He hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which. doesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.. Tanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?. One, Uncle Pat.. Take that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.. I bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?. The paper, Mr. Timoney.. We don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?. I'm his nephew, sir.. Is it Gerry Sheehan we have here?. No, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.. Another nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory. in the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper. or keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?. Frank, sir.. Can you read?. I can, sir.. Do you want to earn a sixpence?. I do, sir.. Come here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.. Your name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.. I will, sir.. Are you sure you can read?. I am, sir.. You can call me Mr. Timoney.. I will, Mr. Timoney.. Uncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me. money an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?. Oh, all right, Ab, all right.. The bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Café where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.. The dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.. The Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?. No, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.. He stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?. He gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.. Mam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.. The next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?. He's my uncle.. You're supposed to be at the Confraternity.. I'm working, Declan.. You're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're. destroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?. Uncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.. Ah, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.. Uncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.. At the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.. Mam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.. Next morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.. You're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are. always telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.. He lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.. Nothing, Mr. Timoney.. I think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.. Declan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.. He makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and. uncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells. knows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in. works. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you. I'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.. Mr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.. A woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.. That's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.. Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.. And he laughs.. Mam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.. Declan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's. see it. have. my. me he. the gas. what. prefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.. Mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.. Then one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.. Why, Dad?. Never mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.. He stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.. Then there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new. baby?. Och, aye, son.. I'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.. Mam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.. Don't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.. We sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.. In a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.. Stop your ticklin',. Ickle ickle icklin. Stop your ticklin', Jock.. Dad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.. Bridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.. Mam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.. Ronald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.. No, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?. Jesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.. Still an' all, Bridey, he's right.. Suddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.. Bridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.. She pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.. Mam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.. She's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.. Yerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.. While Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.. I have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.. Mam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.. Grandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.. Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.. He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?. The babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.. They would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.. They dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.. Malachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?. Alphonsus Joseph.. The words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even. Irish.. Grandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella. needs a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.. I stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.. The house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.. In awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.. Mam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.. I don't want it. You can keep it.. I said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.. Rue? What's rue?. Never mind what's rue. Come down here at once.. Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.. In the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd. think he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.. The lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.. Grandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.. Malachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.. Now, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.. Now, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.. He walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read. him out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.. We walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.. He's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.. I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.. The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.. Why, my child?. I was hungry, Father.. And why were you hungry?. There was nothing in my belly, Father.. He says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his. head. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.. I wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?. I tell him I do but I don't.. Go home, child. Pray for me.. No penance, Father?. No, my child.. I stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.. You're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to. himself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.. 'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.. My heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.. She's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.. VIII. I'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.. Mikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.. Mikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.. The grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.. That's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.. Quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?. But you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?. Quasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.. Billy signs.. Friday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.. Quasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.. Quasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.. He's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!. Mikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.. Our mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.. But Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.. She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.. I swear.. If you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.. I swear.. Only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.. I swear.. All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that. misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.. We are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism. question, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?. But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want. to lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.. She helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?. Dad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.. The day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.. Dr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.. Mam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.. The bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.. Mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.. I fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking. me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.. It's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.. Sister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.. My ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.. Son, are you awake?. I try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?. The tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.. Sister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?. Dad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.. The other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.. The room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?. I'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?. I am.. Are you better?. I am.. Well, why are you here?. I don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and. give me medicine.. What do you look like?. I wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.. Yoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?. I am.. What's your name?. Frank.. That's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.. But I'll be eleven in August, next month.. Well, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you. want to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.. I have diphtheria and something else.. What's something else?. They don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts. because my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?. I have black hair.. You and millions.. I have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.. You and thousands.. I have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where. they put in the soldier's blood.. Oh, God, did they?. They did.. You won't be able to stop marching and saluting.. There's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's. voice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?. I do, Sister.. Do you hear me, Francis?. I do, Sister.. You could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You. could be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.. She comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.. She leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.. She plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.. Mam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my. brothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.. Patricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.. Oh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.. Ah, God, don't do that, nurse.. Very well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.. When she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.. The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.. I do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.. The history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.. Patricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.. Patricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.. He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,. A coat of the claret velvet,. and breeches of brown doe skin,. They fitted with never a wrinkle,. his boots were up to the thigh.. And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,. His pistol butts a-twinkle,. His rapier hilt a-twinkle,. under the jewelled sky.. Every day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.. I'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.. Ah, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.. He bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's. your English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.. Sister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life. of a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.. The Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.. There are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.. Seamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.. She shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.. Nurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.. The nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.. He knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.. It wasn't, Seamus.. I know and didn't I tell her that.. Patricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all. their perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know. means and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the. do it must be terrible.. He comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.. The July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.. No, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.. I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.. Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!. Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!. Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.. He hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.. Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on. about. what it. English. the highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.. Seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.. The girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.. Seamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.. I can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.. I can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.. It's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.. I'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.. She won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.. Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.. After fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.. People are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?. It's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.. Mam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.. I lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.. When Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.. I don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.. Wodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.. I can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.. We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.. Mam says, It won't kill you.. She doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.. Then a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.. I know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?. I have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He. dictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.. Dad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.. The next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.. The name of my composition is-. The title, McCourt, the title.. The title of my composition is, ""Jesus and the Weather. "". What?. ""Jesus and the Weather. "". All right, read it.. This is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would. have liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.. Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.. Mr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?. I did, sir.. Did your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.. Come here, McCourt.. I follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?. I did, sir.. I'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.. Mr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?. It's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.. Cruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.. Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.. If they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.. Sir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?. They did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.. Mr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and. bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.. He calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.. I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.. When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.. At night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all. the Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.. I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.. I feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.. Day and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.. There is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.. Sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.. The minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can. never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.. We fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.. The flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.. We can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.. Mam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.. Next year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?. Sister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?. I did, Sister.. And did you receive?. I did, Sister.. She takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that. chair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.. The dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?. Nothing.. Yes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?. I am, Sister.. He's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.. Ah, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.. Do, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?. Indeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.. The girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.. She leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.. and I tells. I am.. Well, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.. Surely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home. wonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway. me Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get. home my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.. It's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.. It's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?. Sick horse, son. Go home.. The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.. Michael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.. The stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.. Michael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.. One of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.. The men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.. No rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.. Ye are destroyin' that horse.. Can't ye have respect for the dead?. Go easy with that poor horse.. The stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'. about? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.. IX. Mam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.. Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.. Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.. What is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.. Families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.. Some families sing,. Yip aye aidy aye ay aye oh. Yip aye aidy aye ay,. We don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.. If there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.. The families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.. Sean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.. Brendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.. At times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.. Dad says a factory is no place for a woman.. Mam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have. electricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?. He says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?. I do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.. He sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.. We're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.. An egg.. Mam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.. It's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her. bread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.. There are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.. Prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.. The men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.. They laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.. In the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.. The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.. I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?. Some men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.. The men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.. The train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station. steps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.. Dry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?. Dad, Dad, don't go, Dad.. Tommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and. bones.. Peter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,. God help us.. Larry, mind them bloody bombs.. Christy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of. diseases.. Jackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,. Jack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.. Dad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,. above all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.. Back at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.. We sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.. Surely.. Mam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?. All we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.. Bridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.. We know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes. is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.. We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.. The families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.. There are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.. Everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.. Telegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.. Aw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?. I know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.. The children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.. Once the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.. Mr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.. Mam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says. don't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.. You don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.. There's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.. She's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.. What's that? says Mam.. Your fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in. it.. But I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before. she stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.. I think they're getting better.. That's good, and she goes back to bed.. The eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the. poor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.. There are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.. Mr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.. And what's up with you?. 'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.. Oh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?. 'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.. All right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.. Two long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?. My son. The eyes.. Ah, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.. 'Tis an infection, missus.. Sure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.. What's that now?. Babies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.. And where would I get a caul?. Don't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.. Mam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.. Dr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him. in.. What does he have, Doctor?. The worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and. something else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.. How long will he be in, Doctor?. Only God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with. bandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.. In the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.. The whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.. I try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.. I have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you. might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?. I have an infection, Seamus.. Yerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.. I want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket. and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.. Mam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.. Mr. Timoney.. Who is it? Who do we have?. Frank McCourt, sir.. Francis, ah, Francis.. Mam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.. Well, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin. nor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?. I have an infection in my eyes.. Ah, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,. you're too young for that.. Mr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?. With them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond. reading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?. Mam says, Terrible world but God is good.. Indeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?. We did, Mr. Timoney.. Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.. Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.. I'm sorry, Seamus.. I have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.. I won't, Seamus.. He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.. They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.. The Owl looked up to the stars above,. And sang to a small guitar,. O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,. What a beautiful Pussy you are,. You are,. You are.. What a beautiful Pussy you are.. They say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.. What a beautiful Pussy you are.. Then Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.. Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.. I want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.. I'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.. Mr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in. a pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.. Mam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.. No, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.. Mam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.. She knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.. There is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled. against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.. Then Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your. name?. Timothy Creagh, sir.. Creagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.. I do, sir. Indeed I do.. And what do you want, Creagh?. Ah, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd. like to see Dr. Feeley.. Well, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that. are going against your stomach.. Ah, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the. pains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to. the people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?. And the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead. and Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.. The public assistance, is. 'Tis, Mr. Kane.. And where's your husband?. Oh, he's in England, but-. England, is it? And where. that what you want, woman, the relief?. is the weekly telegram, the big five. pounds?. He didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.. Is that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men. of Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?. He looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.. Mam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?. Oh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.. I want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're. taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.. Oh, yes, Mr. Kane.. And what's your name?. McCourt, sir.. That's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.. He's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from. the Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.. Why don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?. I don't know, sir.. You don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.. He looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.. He whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.. We follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.. X. It's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.. The bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.. We sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at. O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.. Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.. I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.. I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.. Lemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.. There's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.. My brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.. We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.. Roddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.. Alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.. The three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.. There's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.. Mam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.. I have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.. There's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.. Malachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.. Mam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from. olden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.. We push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.. We collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.. When we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.. Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.. Malachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.. There's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?. Michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.. He won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.. Where's your father?. He's in England.. Well, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.. You can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.. It might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.. He pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?. I tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.. They scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.. They push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.. Grandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?. My mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.. She wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.. Guard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.. The doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.. I tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.. Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.. She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.. Grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.. When you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by. the range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.. We're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.. She gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?. Michael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?. Pneumonia, says Malachy.. Well, now, that's better than oldmonia.. We don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.. He sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.. She calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your. aunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.. Aunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.. The alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.. Her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.. The streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.. The church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.. Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.. I don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?. She cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.. After school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.. I don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.. There are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.. Before Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.. I could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.. Aunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.. I want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.. There are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.. We don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.. You can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.. Grandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.. Malachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.. Next day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?. We are, son.. Alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.. Malachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.. Mam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.. In a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Café with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.. The next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the. jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.. She says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.. We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.. Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.. There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.. This is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.. My mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.. The door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.. I don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.. Mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from. Kathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.. It isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.. There's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.. XI. Mam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.. All she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.. I don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.. I remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.. The dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.. I'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.. Billy says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.. We have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up. kicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.. Malachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.. Peter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.. Mikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.. Peter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.. The pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.. Peter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.. I tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.. Naw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.. You don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.. I'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the. nine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?. What's what?. Conceived.. That's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are. nine months later.. I don't know what you're talking about.. He whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't. like the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.. I'm not an egg.. You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.. Why am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.. All bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.. They're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.. What am I going to do?. Nothing. You're doomed.. Can't I light a candle or something.. You could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.. But I don't have a penny for the candle.. All right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you. get a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.. The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?. Retreat, says Peter.. That's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.. What's up with you, Peter? says the barman.. What was that you said before, Tommy?. Everything has an opposite.. Mother o' God.. Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?. The pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint. drinkers, amn't I?. Begod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.. That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?. I could be the champion of no pints at all.. Ah, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all. right at home?. Tommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at. all.. Peter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to. your mother, Mikey.. You didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.. You're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints. for me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know. what 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.. Peter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.. A penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his. excitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.. Saturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.. There are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.. We walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.. Mam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.. Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?. Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.. Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.. Mam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.. Mam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.. Bridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?. 'Tis, Bridey.. I'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.. I'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.. Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.. First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.. That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.. There are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in. the shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.. When the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.. We cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.. We have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?. The bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.. The horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.. The streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans. on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.. I'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?. Uncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.. Uncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?. I was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.. Your eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.. Wash them when you go home.. I will, Uncle Pa.. Mr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my. morning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.. On the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.. People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?. They're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.. Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.. She heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.. I want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.. You can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.. I want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.. She comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?. The blinking.. Blinking is not exercise.. Seamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.. Mam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.. Blinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing. Jap.. I don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are. clearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.. He hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.. Surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.. The horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking. like the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.. I work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.. Mr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.. They don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.. Then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.. There are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.. The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.. The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.. I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them. on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.. I wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.. Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.. My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.. Mam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.. She says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.. And I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?. Mam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.. She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.. I don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.. Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor. about his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.. The man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?. McCourt, sir.. Tell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand. that?. I do, sir.. The doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.. In a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?. Oh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.. She smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.. He shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.. Did you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?. I didn't, Mrs. Hannon.. You were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,. the nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.. I feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.. I think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.. Like a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.. I won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.. You have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.. That's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.. You'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.. Hannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.. Can I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?. They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.. Mam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.. XII. There's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.. Mam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.. Now it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.. We're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.. Mam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.. He says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.. He takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.. He hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.. I have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.. Lights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.. Thank you very much and Happy Christmas.. Happy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.. Thank you very much, sir.. We wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.. There is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.. He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.. Don't talk about your father like that.. I say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.. Next day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?. Och, no, Angela.. Michael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.. Oh, I do.. He takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.. She opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are. gone.. Could you spare it? she says.. She shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have. chocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.. Mam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,. jobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?. You drank the money, Dad.. You drank the money, Dad.. You drank the money, Dad.. We're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,. now boys. Respect for your father.. He puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man. but don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.. He comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.. We have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.. Dad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.. He tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.. Mam says, Where are you going?. London.. On this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?. It's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give. the workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.. And how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?. The way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.. He kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it. Frank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.. Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?. Mam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.. Michael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?. 'Twill.. Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?. The two eyes, I think.. Malachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.. Dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,. goes out the door and pulls it shut.. Mam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will. this rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.. The rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.. We go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.. You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.. Michael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells. Michael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.. The lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.. The lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.. We all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.. Michael cries.. Grandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?. Sunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.. One night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.. Ah, no, Kathleen. It's all right.. No. Come in.. They give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry. jam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?. I love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.. Oh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.. I don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.. When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.. Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.. After the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,. oh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.. That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.. Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.. And Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?. What, Mrs. Purcell?. That Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks. behind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.. Mam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.. Oh, we'd never touch the beams.. She goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.. We run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.. Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.. She's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?. Grandma says, What room?. I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?. There were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened. to the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?. Grandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?. Ye don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.. Mam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?. Michael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this. takes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?. Mam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.. No lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.. He goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.. She tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.. She pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.. Grandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?. How would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.. She pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.. What? What? What? What?. There's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till. they get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.. All right, all right, all right, all right.. He hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.. Grandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.. Grandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.. Mam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.. Once we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.. Malachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.. But I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.. It's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.. We can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.. Michael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.. Mam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.. There's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is. disgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.. Mam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.. There are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.. There are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.. Mam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.. Mam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.. We work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.. Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.. When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.. Laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.. The librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.. She picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate. places. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.. Laman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.. Mam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.. Grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.. Her oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.. His wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.. The Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.. Now I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.. XIII. Boys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.. The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.. Of course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?. 'Tis.. And I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do. you?. I don't.. And you'd like to help your mother?. I would.. Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want. you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.. I don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.. Laman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.. It's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.. There are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.. I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.. Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that. word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.. All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.. All these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.. Hoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.. There are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.. If we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.. He sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.. In seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks. and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.. Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,. There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule. The village master taught his little school.. A man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.. Full well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.. Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.. Full well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.. He always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.. The village all declared how much he knew.. 'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.. In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.. And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.. We know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.. I think it's shining, sir.. Pithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.. Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.. Adroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.. I will, sir.. Tell your mother come and see me.. I will, sir.. Mam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a. decent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.. Well, ask him.. I can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.. She comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the. messenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.. He tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.. Mam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.. I wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.. A few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.. She knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?. Mam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?. We don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.. Mam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?. I am.. That's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.. Is it? I don't remember.. Stephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?. I do.. And now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.. Her face tightens and she's angry. You are never to. be an altar boy. let anybody. slam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?. She starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the. world to be a family of messenger boys.. I don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to. stay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.. I'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.. Mr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.. You must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?. I do, sir.. Priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.. I ask for the application.. I will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?. That's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.. Oh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?. Trains?. No. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?. It has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean. disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?. In the Sahara?. No, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?. Thirteen.. Go home to your mother.. It's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in. Roden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.. Mam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.. He's only twelve and he doesn't understand.. I'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.. I know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be. a sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.. One Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.. And why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.. I can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.. The priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.. And what have you done since then, my child?. I hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.. Yes, my child, and what else?. I – I - I did dirty things, Father.. Ah, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?. Some class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.. The night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.. When Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.. Did you empty the chamber pot today?. Oh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.. He shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the. bike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.. I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.. You will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?. Mam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.. Well, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.. But he couldn't do it, says Mam.. He tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.. Shut up and go to bed.. You can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised. me.. I'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get. up from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.. He pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby. eyes.. I won't. You promised me.. He punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My. mother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.. I'll kill you, you little shit.. Mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.. I hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.. He says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.. I can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.. In awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.. I leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Café. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.. The streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the café he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.. He's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?. I tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.. He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.. I wonder what I'll do tomorrow.. XIV. In the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.. It's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.. Mam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?. No.. Ah, do, Frankie. Come on.. I live here now. I'm never going back.. But Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big. brother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.. I can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.. His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain. in my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.. There's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.. He complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.. I get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.. Sometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.. That's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.. Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.. I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.. Doom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.. I walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a. castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.. Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.. Some houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.. Beyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.. I bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.. Oush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.. And Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.. Out beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.. The Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.. I always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't. eat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.. That's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.. Michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.. There's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.. She's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.. I'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.. The paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.. Adultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing ""The Road to Rasheen. "" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.. I can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.. Miss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?. Thanks, Miss O'Riordan.. I'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.. Then there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.. St. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.. The priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.. Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.. How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?. I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.. I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have. everyone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.. Still, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Yütang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.. Turgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.. My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.. Miss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.. And what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.. She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.. Mother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.. Well, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.. Oh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.. But I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.. Out or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Yütang, indeed. Out.. There's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Yütang.. The People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.. The day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'. decency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.. I have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?. I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.. I can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.. He hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.. I chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.. I look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.. The sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in. the wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.. The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?. That's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.. What big job?. Telegram boy at the post office.. She says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be. in a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.. The next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the. kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.. Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets. a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.. By the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?. I can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.. Well, she says, that's more than your father would do.. XV. It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.. He can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.. I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.. On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?. Nine.. All right.. She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She. doesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.. Why do I have to be an hour late?. Do what you're bloody well told.. There are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are. two women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.. What kind of work would that be now?. Telegram boy, miss.. The thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the. lavatories.. No, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and. there's supposed to be a job.. Oh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?. I do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.. Isn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the. thin woman.. Your job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.. The telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.. Aunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.. Carbolic soap.. They smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.. She takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.. I turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.. Monday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.. Mrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.. I'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.. Temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.. Mrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address. first, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.. One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.. Is that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.. She's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.. Tongue?. Dennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?. What tongue? says I.. The tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.. So up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.. Back I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him. making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.. She shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.. Mrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?. She's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.. No, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.. I will, Mrs. Clohessy.. Do.. ***. At the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of. my life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.. It's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.. Michael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Café and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing. and dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.. There are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.. People in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.. The best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.. Protestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.. The Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.. The worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.. When you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.. Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.. A fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.. But Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.. What are you supposed to do?. You're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.. I want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.. Mrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle. over the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?. I want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.. I can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.. That's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.. The telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil. a potato for. bread, bring. O'Connor the. some soap so. grateful and. my troubles.. her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of. her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever. say a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all. Ah, no thanks, ma'am.. Take the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.. I couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.. Take the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver. my telegram anymore.. Oh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.. Good night, son. Be good to your mother.. Good night, Mrs. Daly.. School starts in September and some days Michael stops at The. Abbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,. Can I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.. When Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.. The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.. Malachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and the Abbot sings ""The Road to Rasheen"" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.. There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.. The boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.. There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?. I said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.. I'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear. me?. I did, Miss Barry.. You have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.. Shut up, Mackey.. I will, Miss Barry.. Not another word, Mackey.. No, Miss Barry.. I said shut up, Mackey.. All right, Miss Barry.. That's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.. Mother o' God give me patience.. Yes, Miss Barry.. Take the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.. I will, Miss Barry.. Toby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film. called The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.. Toby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.. Toby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.. Mrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.. When I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.. The boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.. I cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.. I skidded on my bike.. Come in and I'll put something on your cuts.. I wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.. She puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?. Ah, no.. Ah, do.. I will.. I drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam. rise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.. There she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.. She puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.. We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.. What's up with you?. I think it's because it's the first time.. I tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and. splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.. I thought you were cut.. For weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.. One Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?. Yes, she's in the hospital.. Is she in the sanatorium?. I said she's in the hospital.. She's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she. doesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the. sanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.. The next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.. I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.. Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.. On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.. I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.. Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.. It's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.. XVI. Mrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a. dry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.. This isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?. Irish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.. You'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.. He leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.. This is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?. Ah, a lemonade will be lovely.. I am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.. I gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.. I'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.. I - I, -. Oi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.. I was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.. Heaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.. Ah, no, thanks.. Ah, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.. Ah, no thanks.. Ah, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it. into my mouth.. He collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest. a moment.. My stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and. throw up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.. You, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the. window, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?. He pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.. I climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.. I was, I was,. You was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.. He made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.. Made you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.. But I need the job. I have to save and go to America.. America. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.. I hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and. throw a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.. Mam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.. She gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll. let me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.. Every Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.. I'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.. Theresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.. I look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.. I'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.. The priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.. I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.. I swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.. I still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.. There's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?. Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.. Young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?. I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.. Arrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?. I can.. She wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.. I'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.. Mrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?. Oh, I will.. From now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.. In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.. My first letter,. Dear Mrs. O'Brien,. Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.. I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?. I think it means this is your last chance.. I write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.. I run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.. The next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.. Week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.. Dear Mrs. O'Brien,. Inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.. Next week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.. On Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.. She rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.. Sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.. Often I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.. My mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.. I'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.. ***. Some of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.. Mam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.. I'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?. Lemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.. You'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.. Don't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your. father but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.. I will, Uncle Pa.. I hear you're taking that exam for the post office?. I am.. Why would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a. postman in no time and it has the pension.. Ah, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the. pension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?. I do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.. What did he say?. Make up your own mind.. True for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions. and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?. I will, Uncle Pa.. The day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.. I stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.. The man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?. I want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.. The manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.. I write,. Frank McCourt,. 4 Little Barrington Street,. Limerick City,. County Limerick,. Ireland. I am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.. What's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?. I don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.. Little Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.. They call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.. Don't be getting above yourself, boy.. Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.. You live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do. you understand that, McCourt?. I do, sir.. You have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.. You have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.. You have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.. Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.. Then there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.. You can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?. I can, Mr. McCaffrey.. Well, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to. ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.. In the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?. No, Mr. McCaffrey.. Another thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.. No IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.. Mrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.. True for you, says Miss Barry.. Too good for us, I suppose.. True for you.. Do you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?. Oh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.. Did you hear that, Miss Barry?. I did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.. He spoke.. He did, indeed.. He will rue the day, Miss Barry.. Rue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.. Mrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for. their telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.. I don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.. And who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?. He is, Mrs. O'Connell.. And after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?. We do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.. She whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.. A disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.. She keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.. Going to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.. Miss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?. He is, Miss Barry.. I don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I. say I'm sorry? Good-bye?. I lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,. Go on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.. They're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.. XVII. I don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?. Mrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.. She must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.. A person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.. The barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.. And what is it you'd like? says the barman.. I'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.. Oh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure. there's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?. There isn't, sir.. Uncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.. The men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.. I tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.. The men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.. Uncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about. concentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.. Uncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.. All right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.. He says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.. Ah, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.. He closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but. I'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.. He says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.. Jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.. I'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.. It's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.. Your Uncle Pa should know better.. I stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.. She turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.. Did you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.. Mind your own bloody tongue.. Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.. I'll talk to you any bloody way I like.. You have a mouth like a messenger boy.. Do I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of. Laman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.. She walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,. Laman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.. I fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.. In the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?. No.. 'Tis your birthday.. I don't care.. She calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your. stomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.. I have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.. I begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.. I'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.. St. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.. There is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.. My child, my child, my child.. I'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.. My child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.. I'm sixteen today, Father.. Oh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?. I drank my first pint last night.. Yes? I hit my mother.. God help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything. else?. I can't tell you, Father.. Would you like to go to confession?. I can't, Father. I did terrible things.. God forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die. for us.. I can't tell, Father. I can't.. But you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?. He doesn't help me anymore.. But you love him, don't you?. I do. My name is Francis.. Then tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that. trouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?. I talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.. Father Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?. His brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.. But I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.. No, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.. Are you sure, Father?. I am, my child.. He blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy. trotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.. Monday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.. Mr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.. When I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.. They laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.. Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.. I'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.. Mr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a. bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.. Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.. Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.. The train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?. 'Twas.. Where is he?. Oh, he went out.. I know he went out. Where did he go?. I don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.. Didn't say anything?. I didn't hear him say anything.. Do you work with him?. I do. I'm taking over the bike.. What bike?. The messenger bike.. Is he on a messenger bike?. He is.. He told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?. I feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to. get him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.. Well, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.. I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.. We walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.. I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.. I didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.. I won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.. Oh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?. No, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?. She told me.. She did?. She did, honest to God.. Jasus.. He bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,. Of course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.. Mr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.. Every shop, Mr. McCaffrey?. I'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.. I'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.. Why?. We can sell 'em, me an' Peter.. Why?. 'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.. What's birth control?. Aw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,. rubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.. Up the pole?. Pregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.. I'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.. What about Peter?. Leave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you. do ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.. Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.. Mr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?. What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.. Ma'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.. What filth?. Can't tell you. Come on, boys.. We throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey. is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.. The biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?. Some shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?. He demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.. On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through. shops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.. Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.. Eamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.. Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.. Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.. Malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.. She looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.. She gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love. the bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.. She says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.. Chamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?. Of course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.. He's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?. I do, Mr. Sliney.. Ah. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?. I did, Mr. Sliney.. He's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.. I will, Mr. Sliney.. I'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?. I am, Mr. Sliney.. Is he listening to me, missus?. Oh, he is, Mr. Sliney.. Good. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can. whisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.. ***. Halvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.. Every day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?. There are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.. I keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not. coughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.. I read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.. Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.. Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.. Dear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.. Dear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.. In the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.. Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.. XVIII. I'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should. have over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.. She sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.. I'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.. The Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.. I sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.. Another sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.. The man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?. I do.. I tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?. We will.. Alphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?. Michael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.. Alphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?. Mam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this. life. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.. On my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.. I want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.. Now there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.. Mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.. He sings ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?. I don't know.. The Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.. Uncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.. Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice. only.. All right. I'll try.. We all join in the chorus of her sad song,. A mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,. You'll miss her when she's gone.. Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.. Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.. We stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.. No, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.. Oh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.. Mam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.. It's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.. Surely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.. It's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.. He's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.. The priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.. Three days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.. Three American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?. The day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.. The Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.. The priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.. I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.. The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?. The man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.. Oh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.. Is that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.. He climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.. The captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.. After dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.. He invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.. The priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.. Pawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.. Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.. The priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.. The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?. Frank McCourt.. Nice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?. Yes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.. The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.. The what?. Lavatory.. Oh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.. She pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and. whispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.. I stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at. a time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.. I finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.. Frieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.. The First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.. The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and. falls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.. We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.. We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.. I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?.

I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. Southside, Southside. We gon' set this party off right. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. Westside, Westside. We gon' set this party off right. Oh, when it all. [Verse 1: Kanye West]. Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious. She has no idea what she doin' in college. That major that she majored in don't make no money. But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny. Now, tell me that ain't insecurr. The concept of school seems so securr. Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr. She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"". 'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs. Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care. She's so precious with the peer pressure. Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis. She had hair so long that it looked like weave. Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve. And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe. Single black female addicted to retail, and well. [Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down. Oh, when it all. . [Verse 2: Kanye West]. Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious. That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches. Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy. I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!. Then I spent four hundred bucks on this. Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this"". And I can't even go to the grocery store. Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team. It seem we livin' the American Dream. But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem. The prettiest people do the ugliest things. For the road to riches and diamond rings. We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us. We tryna buy back our 40 acres. And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop. Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe. [Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. Come on, come on. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. Come on, come on. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. And when it all falls down. . [Verse 3: Kanye West]. I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em. We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom. We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em. Things we buy to cover up what's inside. 'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth. That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?"". Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack. And the white man get paid off of all of that. But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou. 'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou. Before I had a house and I'd do it again. ‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz. I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific. I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific. I got a problem with spendin' before I get it. We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it. [Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. C'mon, c'mon. And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down. Oh, when it all, it all falls down. Southside, Southside. We gon' set this party off right. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. Westside, Westside. We gon' set this party off right. Oh when it all, it all falls down. Chi-Town, Chi-Town. We gon' show 'em how we get down. I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down. Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life. C'mon. Oh when it all, it all falls down.

There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man. I'd gladly risk it all right now. It's a life-or-death situation, man. Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man. It's your boy, Kanye to the…. Chi-Town, what's goin' on?. Uh-huh, yeah, yeah. . [Verse 1]. I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert. Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp. That right there could drive a sane man berserk. Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk. How do you console my mom or give her light support. Tellin' her her son's on life support?. And just imagine how my girl feel. On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till. She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine. She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign. No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed. Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man. Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band.

I couldn't believe it. But I'm still here for y'all right now, man. This what I got to say right here, dawg. Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh. . [Verse 2]. What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal. On the hottest rap label around?. But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds. It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?. And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory. And what we need to do in the game. Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time. In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed. If you could feel how my face felt. You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!). Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt. I swear to God, driver two wanna sue. I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe. My dawgs couldn't tell if I…. I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised. There's been an accident like GEICO. They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael. I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass. Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?. Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash. And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid. Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did. But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph. Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire. [Chorus: Chaka Khan].

498,498,Motorhead - when the sky comes over you,"Bastards LyricsI was looking at the t.v. news. People everywhere blowing a fuse. People everywhere under the gun. Little kids dying never had no fun. Human beings ain't got no brains. Think you're better but you're all the same. Think you're clever but you're all to blame. Here we are again in the same old frame. Shut up, I'm talkin'to you. It's on television so it can't be true. And I can't play the game no more. Wake up and see it through. Kill the many to save the few. I know what the blind man sees. On your feet or on your knees. Headline terror crime on rise. Half ain't true and the rest is lies. Same old smile on the same old face. Same old horse with the same old race. I wouldn't smile if I was you. Don't relax, 'cos it ain't so new. Watch your back, light the light outside. Somebody coming that you just can't bribe. Shut up, I'm talkin'to you. It's on television so it can't be true. But I can't believe their lies no more. Watch out, I'm coming through. Boogey man gonna bite you too. I know what the blind man sees. On your feet or on your knees. I was reading some magazine. It was written for human beings. Can't believe the stuff I read. Human trash for the human head. You humans don't be so proud. You humans don't talk too loud. You humans just ain't too smart. It's enough to break my human heart. Listen up, I'm talkin' to you. Pay attention 'cos I mean you too. And I will tell you something new. Your values ain't worth a dime. Human rights just human crime. I know what the blind man sees. On your feet or on your knees. Riots in the burning street. Crystal night outside. Brutal music in the night, enough to make you cry. Nobody knows how it is to scream and drown the world. I am the midnight snake to bite your little girls. Outside in the distance, the city in the fire. See the houses burning down, mile after mile. I don't think you know about your future yet. I don't think you're gonna like the one you're going to get. Ghost rider in the sky. Burner. Lights outside my window, victims on the floor. Rats in all the bedrooms, thunder at the door. Nobody knows anything, kill and wear a smile. Here comes the pirates baby, don't' you touch that dial. You will never hurt me, you won't put me down. This ain't no circus and I sure don't need no clowns. I will be the one you can't be. I will see the things that you can't see. Demons blind your eyes. Burner. Beat me like a hammer, baby, stick me like a pig. Throw me to the lions, baby, wear me like a wig. I am not only one to walk into the fire. I would rather burn than let them make me a liar. I cannot be beaten, I cannot be like you. I cannot be otherwise, no matter what you do. I am the voice of broken glass. I am the voice to drive you mad at last. I am the truth, the liar turned around. Burner. Burner. Burner. Burner anyway. I saw the millions, the naked and the dead. I saw the city streets running bloody red. I saw a thousand bombers circle in the sky. I saw the firestorm fifty stores high. I saw a hundred thousand scream and burn. I saw the armored wheels grind and turn. Universal soldier, doomed to live to tell. Fight and die forever, burn in bloody hell. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. March forever in the sound and fury. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. Blood and iron it's the same old story. I held the Iron Cross, first class with the swords. I marched with Hitler down the bloody road to war. I was at Jutland loding 'till the gun was hot. Killed at Trafalgar without firing a shot. I was at Moscow, burning in my tank. I was at Shiloh, marching in the ranks. I was a Sturmbannfuhrer fighting in Berlin. I was a Russian Hero dying for Stalin. Death or glory, Death or glory. March forever in the sound and fury. Death or glory, Death or glory. Blood and iron it's the same old story. I swung a saber and I was a young Hussar. I was a Cossack, fighting for the Czar. I was a Viking, Berserker from the North. A Roman Gladiator murdered just for sport. I was with Bonaparte I died at Waterloo. I was a Frankish Knight, a Polish Jew. I was a Spartan in the Trojan Wars. I was a warrior for Crazy Horse. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. March forever in the sound and fury. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. The Loner Survivor but no comfort for me. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. Executioner, Judge and Jury. Death or Glory, Death or Glory. Blood and iron it's the same old story. Auf Stehen!!!. Murder I am, you know it was me. I was the one, that you didn't see. I was the cut, down to you bone. I put you there under that stone. I, I am the blade, I am the dream of the brave. I, I am the knife, I bring grief to you wife. I, I am the sword, I am the word of the Lord. Do what you will, I bring you the edge. I am the one to sever your head. I cut so deep, I can cut straight. All depends on the moves you make. I, I am the blade, I am the promise unmade. I, I am the knife, I bring death to your life. I, I am the ax, to stop you dead in your tracks. I, I am the sword, I bring the fear of the Lord. Centuries pass, dust in the wind. I shall remain, shining in sin. The metal I am, the iron you feel. The song of the dead, the chorus of steel. I, I am the blade, I break the oath that you made. I, I am the mace, I am the blow in the face. I, I am the ax, to cut down heroes like rats. I, I am the sword, I do the work of the Lord. Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear. I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear. Shake and bop, don't you stop. Cance like a maniak until you drop. I don't mind, I don't mind. I can tun a razor right up your spine. What are you waiting for. What do you think you were created for. Show us, you care, show us you dare. You don't know what happened, not if you weren't there. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. We know how to do it and we do it real well. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. Voodoo medicine cast my spell. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. Play that guitar just like ringing a bell. Take it or leave it. Going for broke, rock 'til you choke. It don't matter if you drink or smoke. Speak through the beat, get up on your feet. Sweating like a hpund dog, white as a sheet. Don't you be scared, don't you be scared. Everybody terrified, it don't seem fair. What are you waiting for. What do you think you were created for. Out of your seat, blind in the heat. Do the nasty boogie mama, stomp your feet. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. We know how to do it and we do it real well. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. We know how to do it and we do it real well. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. Go back to zero take a pill and get well. Be a good soldier and die where you fell. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. We know how to do it and we do it real well. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. Go on out and boogie 'cos you never can tell. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. Be a good soldier and die where you fell. Born to raise hell, Born to raise hell. We know how to do it and we do it real well. Little girl sleeping in dreams of peace. Mommy been gone a long time. Daddy comes home and she still sleeps. Waiting for the world worst crime. And he comes up the stairs like he always does. And he never turns on the light. And she's wide awake, scared to death. She smells his lust and she smells his sweat. Curled in a ball she holds her breath. Praying to a God that she's never met. Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me. Goodnight. Little girl lies by her Daddy's side. And she listens to him breathe. She knows there's something awful wrong. That she's far too young to see. And she knows she can't tell anyone. She's too full of guilt and shame. And if she tells she'll be all alone. They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home. And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone. Praying to her God with his heart of stone. Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me. Goodnight. Why, tell me why. The worst crime, in the world. And so Daddy lies by his daughter's side. And he sleeps deep and well. No nightmares come to him tonight. Though his daughter lives in hell. For his seed is sown where it should not be. But the beast in his mind don't care. And the only sound are tears that fell. Little girl turns her face to the wall. She knows that no-one hears her call. But it seems that God hears nothing at all. Don't let Daddy kiss me, don't let Daddy kiss me. Goodnight. Shoot me down, baby look at you move. Dancing like you ain't got a thing to lose. Your fight for breath. Way you look scare a man to death. I can't speak, my heart's on fire. You're the focus of my desire. Can't be real, can't be true. You might be a virgin, but you ain't brand new. I know you're a bad, bad woman. Turn around and you'll see me coming. I know you're a bad, bad woman. Good enough for me. Here I come baby watch my smoke. Gotta getcha and it ain't no joke. I hope your body ain't telling me lies. You bring a tear to my lying eyes. I wish I could, I wish I might. Get the wish I wish tomight. Drive me crazy turn me inside put. Gotta have you baby, ain't no doubt. I know you're a bad, bad woman. Turn around and you'll see me coming. I know you're a bad, bad woman. Good enough for me. Give it up baby, let me jump your bones. Fired up, almost grown. Can't believe you want me too. Here I come honey, woop - de - do. I know you're a bad, bad woman. One look and you set me running. I know you're a bad, bad woman. Good enough for me. Liar- you take your hand from me. I'll tear it from your wrist. Just take your hand from me. Liar- your mouth is ashes dog, do not presume. To fool me with your tales of god. Liar- Promises of Heaven now. You cannot truly think you are the seven now. Liar- And I will challenge you. All my life I swear that I will challenge you. I will be the watcher, and I will never sleep. Many miles before me, and promises to keep. Driving out the demons, and bring them all to trial. I see the face that cannot smile. Liar- You should be burning now, I know you are. The face and it is turning now. Liar- Your words are filth and false. You are the vile partner in the final waltz. Liar- Will be rid of you, a good day in any life. Will be rid of you. Liar- I see you eyeless smile. There is no other thing upon this world so vile. I will be the hero, and I can do no more. I can be the hero, as I have been before. I can take you places that you have never seen. I can make you pleased that you are clean. Killer- Do not presume I'm fooled. You kill the hearts of many but I'll break your rules. Killer- Don't show your teeth to me. I'll put your teeth and feed you with them count on me. Killer- I am thy killer too. I am the frightful thing that always follows you. Liar- I am thy nemesis. I always knew one day that it would come to this. Why the world is wicked. I know the reason why. Why the world is wicked. I know that it's allowed. I can never leave it the way it was before. I can never disobey - the law. I am a drifter on a hungry empty sea. There is no one on earth to rescue me. The winter storms they freeze me. Summer burned alive. I can't remember when another soul passed by. Marooned and stranded, on the Islands of the Damned. There is no one on earth to take my hand. There is no voice to speak, no soul for company. The sun goes down like blood into the Western Sea. Alone and dying, and a thousand miles from home. I know I never was so bvroken and alone. I searched the sky for God, shivered to the bone. Drowned in sorrow, Lost in the Ozone. No hand for me, abandon me. Wash over me, watch over me, drowned forever. Alone and crying, and a thousand miles astray. Alone upon the cruel sea, forsworn and cast away. I turned my face to God, but his fase was turned away. Lost in the Ozone, nothing left to say. Lost in the Ozone, nothing left to say. Nothing left to say, nothing left to say. Wash over me. Back to back, you see me now. Show me what you're hiding here. I can't move if I don't sing. I can't stand I got no chair. Can't see me, I'm the man, ain't no joke. Can't see me, master plan, up in smoke. Can't hear me, I'm so loud, suits me fine. Can't hear me, I ain't proud, all the time. Follow me, and don't you move. Stop at nothing,show your teeth. I can see you I'm not deaf. Two years later, twice a week. Can't see me, I'm the man, laid in bad. Can't see me, give a damn, Motorhead. Can't hear me, up your way, ring your chimes. Can't hear me, I can't stay, all the time. I can tell you it ain't me. I won't be no beast up there. Turn me 'round 'cos I can't dance. Be a spaceship, I don't care. Can't hear me, stand up straight,row my boat. Can't hear me, hit the deck, fishtail goat. Can't see me, on the game, ain't no crime. Can't see me, aeroplane, all the time. We bear your names, we come to you. We own the game we run to you. We bring the blazing sun to you. We bring the blazing gun to you. We are your children grown and strange. We are your children unashamed. You breed contempt we mock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We bring the shake, we bring the shake. We say these things to shock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We climbed into the mean machine. We saw the ad, we bought the dream. We rather victims of neglect. We will not be what you expect. We are your children, strange and weird. We are your children, free and clear. You breed contempt we mock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We bring the shake, All hearts to break. We bring these words to mock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We bring the shake, All hearts to break. We bring these words to mock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. The only thing that I regret. I didn't take what I could get. You owe us much, you owe us life. We owe you nothing eat the knife. We are your children chosen few. We are your children come for you. We bring the world to shock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We bring the shake, for goodness' sake. We bring the truth to mock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. We bring the shake, we bring the shake. We bring the shake to shock you now. We bring the shake to rock you now. Hear my voice, hear my voice, hear my voice. Make your choice, make your choice, make your choice. Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat the drum. Hide the sun, hide the sun, hide the sun. Devils in my head tonight. All is wrong if it's not right, take care. Whispers in the walls I hear. Nothing ever made quite clear, beware. Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell. Make me well, make me well, make me well. Show your hand, show your hand, show your hand. Make a stand, make a stand, make a stand. Angels in my heart tonight. Say the word and make it right, so dark. Angels flying in my dreams. All is never what it seems, take heart. Speak my name, speak my name, speak my name. Feel no shame, feel no shame, feel no shame. Take your time, take your time, take your time. You are mine, you are mine, you are mine. Monsters in my eyes today. I can't make them go away, it's true. Strangers in the world it seems. Nightmare visions, fever, dreams. I dream of youEmbed",INFP

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"". And I was crying on the staircase. Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said. [Chorus]. Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"". . [Verse 2]. So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew. So close your eyes. Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh. . [Pre-Chorus]. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"". But you were everything to me. I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said. . [Chorus]. Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"". Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult, but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"". [Post-Chorus]. Oh, oh. . [Bridge]. I got tired of waiting. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading. When I met you on the outskirts of town. . [Breakdown]. And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"". He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said. . [Chorus]. ""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"". . [Outro].

598,598,my chemical romance - black parade,"Black Parade On December 4th Lyrics[Verse 1: My Chemical Romance]. When I was a young boy. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band. He said, ""Son, when you grow up. Would you be the savior of the broken. The beaten and the damned?"". He said, ""Will you defeat them. Your demons, and all the non-believers. The plans that they have made?"". ""Because one day I'll leave you. A phantom to lead you in the summer. To join the black parade."". [Verse 2: JAY-Z]. They say ""they never really miss you til you dead or you gone"". So on that note, I'm leaving after the song. So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long. At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on. I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves. Who made love under the sycamore tree, which makes me. A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim. At 10 pounds, when I was born I didn't give her no pain. Although through the years I gave her her fair share. I gave her her first real scare. I made up for birth when I got here. She knows my purpose wasn't purpose. I ain't perfect, I care. But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear. Now I'm just scratching the surface cause what's buried under there. Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared. I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted. But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted. . [Hook: My Chemical Romance]. He said, ""Son, when you grow up. Would you be the savior of the broken. The beaten and the damned?"". He said, ""Will you defeat them. Your demons, and all the non-believers. The plans that they have made?"". ""Because one day I'll leave you. A phantom to lead you in the summer. To join the black parade."". [Verse 3: JAY-Z]. Now all the teachers couldn't reach me. And my momma couldn't beat me. Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, so. With that disdain in my membrane. Got on my pimp game. Fuck the world, my defense came. Then DeHaven introduced me to the game. Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine. I'm a hustler now. My gear is in and I'm in the in crowd. And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now. My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag. Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged. Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had. Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass. I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap. But that came second to me moving this crack. Gimme a second, I swear. I will say about my rap career. Til '96 came, niggas I'm here. Good-bye. . [Hook: My Chemical Romance]. He said, ""Son, when you grow up. Would you be the savior of the broken. The beaten and the damned?"". He said, ""Will you defeat them. Your demons, and all the non-believers. The plans that they have made?"". ""Because one day I'll leave you. A phantom to lead you in the summer. To join the black parade."". [Verse 4: JAY-Z]. Good-bye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush. Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush. And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch. No two days are alike. Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much. And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us. Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up. And the drought will define a man when the well dries up. You learn the worth of water without work, you thirst til you die, yup!. And niggas get tied up for product. And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up. To show mothers they really got em. And this was the stress I lived with till I decided. To try this rap shit for a living. I pray I'm forgiven. For every bad decision I made. Every sister I played. Cause I'm still paranoid to this day. And it's nobody's fault I made the decisions I made. This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me. . [Outro: My Chemical Romance & (JAY Z)]. (If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack. Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black). . When I was a young boy. My father took me into the city. To see a marching band. He said, ""Son, when you grow up. Would you be the savior of the broken. The beaten and the damned?"". He said, ""Will you defeat them. Your demons, and all the non-believers.

Only those that hear my music know my lower depths. The doer does, the knower rests. The scholar learns, the sage forgets. If I could wrap my head around it, then I might get a shot. I get what I think about whether I like it or not. When things go wrong, life doesn't stop. I need to quit pollutin' my mind with sex and violence. The secret that I'm seekin' was left in silence. And my microphone is pointin' God's finger. I'm a saint disguised as a pop singer. Here's a fun fact. Most people leave their potential untapped. There will be more than camping gear to unpack. Sometimes, you gotta go there just so you can come back. [Chorus]. Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby. Slow it down, no more runnin' around. I said slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby. Slow it down, no more runnin' around. . [Verse 2]. My foot hurts, I didn't get sleep. My dad died, my horoscope ain't in sync. I'm misunderstood and Twitter is ruthless. Uh oh, I think my problems are excuses. For not bein' who I know I am. I'm thirty-one, there's no one left to hold my hand. Though I believe I got someone watchin' over me. I believe I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. I believe that even when the road is bleak. That these obstacles were set up just for me. And family matters, I'm on some Urkel shit. Posner on a Primo beat, this some full circle shit. I believe no matter how high the hurdles get. I can flip this whole thing into an internal win. Life ain't meant to be a heavy thing. Met Ram Dass, he told me, ""Just love everything"". Fall in Michigan, there's wisdom in my loose leaf. For the first time, I feel like the true me. [Chorus]. Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby. Slow it down, no more runnin' around. I said slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby. Slow it down, no more runnin' around. . [Verse 3]. Some days, I can't get out of bed. Crippled by negative thoughts inside my head. Like why do I always stop before my limits?. And why am I only good at lovin' people from a distance?. Why am I so vain? Obsessed with fitness?. Why are the only people I'm around my assistants?. But wait, the last time I felt this way. I bucked up, kept goin' and got my shit straight. Diddy told me go with my heart. So my focus is art, not where I go on the chart. The divine light in me loves to glow in the dark. If my life was a movie, we'd be approachin' the part. Where the hero wins and learns don't. Chase what you already got and returns home. Those who say don't know, those who know don't say. I'm done walking with the herd, it's time I go my own way. .

Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind. Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled. When a female fires back. Suddenly big talker don't know how to act. So he does what any little boy would do. Makin' up a few false rumors or two. That for sure is not a man to me. Slanderin' names for popularity. It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad). But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say. [Chorus: Christina Aguilera]. This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world). Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa). Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa). So what do we do girls? Shout louder!. Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground). Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa). Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa). Never can, never will, can't hold us down. . [Post-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]. Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down). Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down). Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down). Never can, never will. . [Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]. So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?. Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?. Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing. Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing. If you look back in history. It's a common double standard of society. The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score. While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore. I don't understand why it's okay. The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named. All my ladies come together and make a change. And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing. [Chorus: Christina Aguilera & Lil' Kim]. This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah). Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth). Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard.

Take a deep breath and say it loud. Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it). . [Verse 3: Lil' Kim]. Here's something I just can't understand. If a guy have three girls then he's the man. He can even give her some head, then sex her raw. If a girl do the same, then she's a whore. But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it. Cats take my ideas and put they name on it. It's alright though, you can't hold me down. I got to keep on movin'. To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack. Do it right back to him and let that be that. You need to let him know that his game is whack. And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back. [Bridge: Christina Aguilera]. You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy. You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things. Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy. You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things. This is for my girls!. .

It's been raining since you left me. Now I'm drowning in the flood. You see I've always been a fighter. But without you I give up. I can't sing a love song. Like the way it's meant to be. Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore. But baby, that's just me. [Chorus]. And I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine. Till the heavens burst and. The words don't rhyme. And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind. And I'll love you, always. . [Verse 2]. Now your pictures that you left behind. Are just memories of a different life. Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry. One that made you have to say goodbye. What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair. To touch your lips, to hold you near. When you say your prayers try to understand. I've made mistakes, I'm just a man. When he holds you close, when he pulls you near. When he says the words you've been needing to hear. I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine. To say to you 'till the end of time. . [Chorus]. Yeah, I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. [Bridge]. If you told me to cry for you. I could. If you told me to die for you. I would. Take a look at my face. There's no price I won't pay. To say these words to you. . [Guitar Solo]. . Well, there ain't no luck. In these loaded dice. But baby if you give me just one more try. We can pack up our old dreams. And our old lives. We'll find a place where the sun still shines. . [Chorus]. And I will love you, baby, always. And I'll be there forever and a day, always. I'll be there till the stars don't shine.

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen. There was a cat that really was gone. Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine. It was a shame how he carried on. . [Verse 2]. He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar. But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar. In all affairs of state, he was the man to please.

Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms. Then one night some men of higher standing. Set a trap, they're not to blame. ""Come to visit us,"" they kept demanding. And he really came. [Chorus]. Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen. They put some poison into his wine. Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine. He drank it all and he said, ""I feel fine"".

654,654,inigo pascual - Remember me,"Cryptonomicon LyricsPROLOGUE. . Two tires fly. Two wail.. . A bamboo grove, all chopped down. . From it, warring songs. . ....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!. . ""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:. Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.. . Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.. . But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.. . As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.. . Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.. . Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.. . So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.. . ``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.. . ""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.. . Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:. . Antenna searches. . Retriever's nose in the wind. . Ether's far secrets. This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.. . But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.. . ``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.. . The leaves of Shanghai:. . Pale doorways in a steel sky.. . Winter has begun.. . . BARRENS. . Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.. . . . As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.. . . . The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.. . . One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.. . Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.. . When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.. . For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.. . The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.. . Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.. . Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.. . The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.. . Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.. . At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.. . The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.. . When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.. . The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.. . Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.. . At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.. . Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.. . There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.. . Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.. . . certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.. . [equation cannot be rendered in text]. . where s is a complex number.. . Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.. . Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.. . But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.. . Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.. . One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.. . Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.. . Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.. . Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.. . It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.. . The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.. . Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.. . ``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.. . ``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.. . There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.. . ``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.. . By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.. . ``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.. . ``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''. . Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''. . . ``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''. . ``Very well,'' Alan said.. . But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.. . . Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''. . . ``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''. . . ``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''. . . ``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''. . . ``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''. . . ``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.. . . ``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''. . . ``Hmmm?''. . . ``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''. . . ``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''. . . ``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.. . . ``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''. . ``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.. . ``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''. . ``I'm not talking about zat!''. . ``And he invented matrices, but--''. . ``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''. . ``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''. . ``Zat is completely different!''. . ``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''. . ``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''. . ``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''. . ``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''. . ``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''. . ``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''. . Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''. . ``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.. . ``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''. . ``All right, Alan.''. . ``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''. . ``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''. . ``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''. . ``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.. . ``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''. . ``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''. . ``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''. . ``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''. . ``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''. . ``Of course Lawrence.''. . ``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''. . Alan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''. . ``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.. . ``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''. . ``I'm not counting anything.''. . Rudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''. . ``It is?''. . Alan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''. . ``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''. . ``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.. . ``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''. . ``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.. . ``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''. . ``I'm not very good with names.''. . ``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''. . ``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''. . ``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''. . ``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''. . ``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''. . ``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.. . ``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.. . ``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''. . ``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.. . ``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''. . ``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''. . ``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''. . ``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.. . ``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.. . ``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''. . ``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''. . ``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''. . ``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''. . ``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''. . ``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.. . ``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''. . ``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:. . . . ``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''. . ``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.. . ``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''. . ``How?''. . ``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly £, and so on.''. . ``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''. . ``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''. . ``Sure. Like 2x.''. . ``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''. . ``Is that all?''. . ``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''. . ``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''. . ``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''. . ``Who is he?''. . ``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''. . ``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.. . ``Who's that?''. . ``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''. . ``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.. . ``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''. . ``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.. . ``Meaning?''. . Alan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''. . ``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.. . ``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''. . `` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''. . ``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''. . ``I get it,'' Lawrence said.. . ``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.. . ``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''. . ``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.. . ``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''. . ``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''. . ``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.. . ``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''. . Soon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.. . He could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.. . Lawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.. . The road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.. . A thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.. . The building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.. . He stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.. . After a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.. . ``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.. . ``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''. . ``Presets?''. . ``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''. . ``Oh.''. . ``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''. . ``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.. . ``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''. . ``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.. . ``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''. . Alan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''. . ``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''. . ``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''. . ``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''. . ``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''. . ``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''. . ``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''. . ``Give me one example,'' Alan said.. . ``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''. . ``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''. . ``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''. . But later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''. . ``Like those angels in Virginia?''. . ``I guess so.''. . ``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''. . ``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''. . . . Soon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.. . He went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.. . They gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?. . Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?. . Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.. . Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.. . The sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.. . Lawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.. . *1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available. . . . NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM. . ``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''. . Randy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.. . ``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''. . ``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''. . Avi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.. . ``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''. . ``So?''. . ``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''. . Randy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.. . ``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.. . ``Shoot.''. . Randy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''. . ``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''. . ``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''. . ``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''. . ``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''. . ``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''. . Randy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.. . ``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''. . ``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''. . Randy laughs.. . Avi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''. . ``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''. . ``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''. . Randy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.. . ``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''. . ``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''. . ``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.. . ``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''. . Avi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.. . ``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.. . ``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.. . Randy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.. . He turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.. . Ordo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.. . The subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''. . We look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.. . This is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.. . The second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''. . Two: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.. . The next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.. . Another principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.. . ``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.. . This shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.. . Luzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.. . The view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.. . Suddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.. . And then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.. . He is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.. . . . This is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:. . ``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.. . The number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.. . He glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.. . Fifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.. . ``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''. . ``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.. . ``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.. . ``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.. . ``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.. . ``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''. . ``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''. . (Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.). . ``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''. . (The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.). . ``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''. . ``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.. . ``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''. . (Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.). . But seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''. . ``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''. . ``OCWs?''. . ``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''. . ``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.. . ``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.. . (Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.. . The government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.). . ``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''. . A word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.. . ``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''. . ``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''. . ``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''. . ``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''. . ``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''. . ``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''. . ``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''. . ``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.. . ``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''. . Avi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''. . ``Pinoy-grams?''. . ``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''. . ``Arday?''. . ``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''. . ``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''. . ``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''. . ``Fingerprint?''. . ``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''. . ``Ordo?''. . ``Yeah.''. . Randy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''. . ``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.. . Randy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.. . . SEAWEED. . Woman holds baby. . Eyes pale as a muzzle flash. . Band chimes frozen tears. . The fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.. . A Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.. . Shaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.. . Shanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.. . The worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.. . It works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.. . Until, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.. . The very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.. . The guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.. . The Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.. . Shaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.. . Twenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.. . Shaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:. . This is my rifle. . There are many like it but. . This rifle is mine.. . He wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.. . Now, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.. . Bobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.. . It had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.. . This had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.. . One of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!. . Shaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.. . The restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.. . The longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.. . Shaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.. . All the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.. . Shaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.. . Other Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.. . It helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.. . The chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.. . Fuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.. . He noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.. . Everyone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.. . Shaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.. . The third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.. . Hell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.. . The chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.. . ``Seaweed.''. . Shaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.. . Shaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.. . Significant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.. . The lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.. . A year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.. . ``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.. . The lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.. . The Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''. . As brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.. . Shaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.. . The guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.. . ``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.. . So much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.. . Not that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.. . In return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.. . . . A couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.. . Now in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.. . One day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.. . Shaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.. . And then they turn and look at Shaftoe.. . That evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''. . Frick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''. . The mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''. . Frick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''. . At lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.. . Around midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.. . Shaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.. . Frick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.. . Shaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.. . ``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.. . ``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.. . ``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''. . Frick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''. . That's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''. . A disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.. . So Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.. . The island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.. . They pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.. . There is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.. . The swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.. . Then the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.. . It was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.. . Manila's perfume. . Fanned by the coconut palms. . The thighs of Glory. . Manila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.. . As their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.. . Manila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.. . Bobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.. . A couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.. . Intramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.. . Damned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.. . ``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.. . Miraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.. . ``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''. . She puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.. . Suddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.. . Ironwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.. . Flowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.. . So. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.. . ``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''. . Mr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''. . ``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.. . Now they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.. . But this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''. . ``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''. . Shaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.. . Cigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.. . Glory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.. . Glory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.. . Mrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.. . Half an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.. . But Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''. . ``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.. . ``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.. . She stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''. . Shaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--. . ``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.. . ``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.. . ``It came from Mexico.''. . ``Ah, go on!''. . Glory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--. . ``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.. . ``I'll be damned.''. . ``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''. . After a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''. . ``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''. . ``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.. . Bobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.. . By the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.. . Sirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.. . ``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.. . Still holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.. . ``It's war, baby,'' he says.. . . . FORAYS. . The lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.. . As soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''. . Randy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.. . He orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.. . Living in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.. . Right now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.. . Avi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939›45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''. . People are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.. . The poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.. . The artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.. . The organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.. . All of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.. . Conferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.. . To Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.. . He knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.. . . . Randy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.. . He paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.. . He is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.. . Unfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.. . The pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.. . Nowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?. . Avi sent him encrypted e-mail:. . When you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.. . Now, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''. . A box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.. . Even a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.. . Some people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.. . Randy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.. . Inside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.. . Ordo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.. . The longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.. . ``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''. . ``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''. . After he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:. . I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.. . The computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.. . If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.. . So the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:. . --Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,. . --Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,. . --Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,. . --Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.. . Randy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.. . . . Randy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.. . Since the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.. . By the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.. . When a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.. . Andy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).. . To Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.. . Andy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.. . In order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.. . Randy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.. . Stimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.. . Unless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.. . Of course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.. . Unfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.. . Fortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.. . How the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.. . The university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.. . He spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.. . Anyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.. . Chester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.. . Not long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.. . To begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.. . Furthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.. . By the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.. . But Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.. . This was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.. . Anyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!. . In the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.. . It was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.. . When it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''. . . INDIGO. . . . Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.. . There is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.. . His scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.. . This is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.. . A tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.. . The band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.. . Another one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.. . Still the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.. . Lawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.. . Probably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.. . As it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.. . The rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.. . Nevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.. . . . At some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.. . He is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.. . Still, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.. . This is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.. . Their new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.. . Glumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.. . Then there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.. . Finally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.. . They are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.. . Someone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.. . Some other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:. . 19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3. . 21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11. . Around the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.. . By the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.. . Waterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:. . 1  14 ||. 2  15 |. 3 ||  16 |. 4  17 ||. 5  18 ||||||. 6 |  19 ||||. 7  20 |. 8 ||||  21 |. 9  22 |. 10  23 |. 11 |  24. 12 |  25 |. 13  26. . The most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.. . The most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--. . Well, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is. . 19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3. . 21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11. . which only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.. . ``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).. . The opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets. . A 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3. . 21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11. . . This narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!. . Schoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.. . Earlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets. . A T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3. . 21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11. . . and then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.. . ``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.. . ``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.. . Commander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''. . The part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.. . *``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.. . At some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.. . The most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.. . *Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.. . This is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.. . As of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.. . As of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.. . Waterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:. . NO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.. . Seems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.. . . . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .. . At about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.. . . . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .. . The words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.. . It all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.. . What are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.. . It is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.. . . . .ACTION . . .. . What is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?. . . . . EFFECT . . .. . So what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?. . If the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.. . Waterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?. . And how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.. . If the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?. . Waterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.. . The orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.. . Waterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.. . The first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.. . The messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.. . The one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed",ESFP

677,677,Taylor Swift - invisible string,"​invisible string Lyrics[Verse 1]. Green was the color of the grass. Where I used to read at Centennial Park. I used to think I would meet somebody there. Teal was the color of your shirt. When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop. You used to work at to make a little money. . [Chorus]. Time, curious time. Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs. Were there clues I didn't see?. And isn't it just so pretty to think. All along there was some. Invisible string. Tying you to me?. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. [Verse 2]. Bad was the blood of the song in the cab. On your first trip to LA. You ate at my favorite spot for dinner. Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip. Getting lunch down by the Lakes. She said I looked like an American singer. . [Chorus]. Time, mystical time. Cutting me open, then healing me fine. Were there clues I didn't see?. And isn't it just so pretty to think. All along there was some. Invisible string. Tying you to me?. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. . [Bridge]. A string that pulled me. Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar. Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire. Chains around my demons. Wool to brave the seasons. One single thread of gold. Tied me to you. [Verse 3]. Cold was the steel of my axe to grind. For the boys who broke my heart. Now I send their babies presents. Gold was the color of the leaves. When I showed you around Centennial Park. Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven. . [Chorus]. Time, wondrous time. Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies. And it's cool. Baby, with me. And isn't it just so pretty to think. All along there was some. Invisible string. Tying you to me?. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Me. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. . [Outro]. (Ah-ah-ah). (Ah-ah-ah)66Embed",INFP

We can find a different song. When the heat is strong. No sense in holding on. Afraid to appear selfish. I lose myself sometimes. Afraid to appear selfish. I lose myself sometimes. But as restless as we are. We'll see another day. And as restless as we are. We can find another way. As a change is taking place. Nothing seems the same. And if we make it down this road. We can make it all the way. To California 1. . California 1. California 1. . And its been so long. They said it's coming on. And the trees are gone. With the flames that took the fawn. But she grows, she grows again. Always resilient. Such a sentimental warmth. In this hostile atmosphere. . Afraid to appear selfish. I lose myself sometimes. Afraid to appear selfish. I lose myself sometimes. But as restless as we are. We'll see another day. And as restless as we are. We can find another way. As a change is taking place. Nothing seems the same. And if we make it down this road. We can make it all the way. To California 1. . California 1. California 1Embed",INFP

Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so. . [Verse 2]. Southern nights. Just as good even when closed your eyes. I apologize. To anyone who can truly say. That he has found a better way. [Verse 3]. Southern skies. Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky). Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye. It goes runnin' through your soul. Like the stories told of old. . [Verse 4]. Old man. He and his dog, they walk the old land. Every flower touched his cold hand. As he slowly walked by. Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy. . [Verse 5]. Feels so good. Feels so good, it's frightening. Wish I could. Stop this world from fighting. La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da. . [Verse 6]. Mystery. Like this and many others in the trees. Blow in the night. In the Southern skies. [Verse 7]. Southern nights. They feel so good, it's a frightening. Wish I could (Southern nights). Stop this world from the fighting. Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da. . [Outro]. Southern skies. Have you ever noticed?10Embed",INFP

And if you see how beautiful you are to me. You'll know I'm not lying. . [Pre-Chorus]. Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye but even if we try. There are some things in this life won't be denied. Won't be denied. [Chorus]. I'm never gonna say goodbye. 'Cause I never wanna see you cry. I swore to you my love would remain.

I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone. And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around. It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on. It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long. . [Pre-Chorus: Calum]. It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?. If what we had was real, how could you be fine?. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. . [Chorus: All]. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. [Bridge: Luke]. If today I woke up with you right beside me. Like all of this was just some twisted dream. I'd hold you closer than I ever did before. And you'd never slip away. And you'd never hear me say. . [Chorus: All]. I remember the day you told me you were leaving. I remember the make-up running down your face. And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them. Like every single wish we ever made. I wish that I could wake up with amnesia. And forget about the stupid little things. Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you. And the memories I never can escape. . [Outro: Luke]. 'Cause I'm not fine at all. No, I'm really not fine at all. Tell me this is just a dream.

Bet they never felt the way we felt. Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do. You and I both know it can't work. It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt. And I don't, I won't let that be you. [Pre-Chorus]. Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know. That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?).

But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do). To fight with time and space. 'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you. . [Verse 2]. See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny. Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby. See we both fighting every inch of our fiber. 'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop. . [Pre-Chorus]. Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know.

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place. But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do). To fight with time and space. 'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you. . [Bridge]. You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be. Baby, we both have the right to disagree. And I ain't with it. And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days. But convention's telling us to let go. So we'll never know. . [Breakdown]. I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place. 'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah. . [Chorus]. I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place. But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do).

725,725,Taylor Swift - All is Well,"Fruit Lyrics[Verse 1: Z.E.K.E]. Same thing that tempted both Adam and Eve. That golden something hanging from The Forbidden Tree. In the Garden of Eden, if you ain't catch my drift. Maybe I should just throw it out there, no Taylor Swift. All I mean is getting rid of my illusions. Confusing my audience with Biblical allusions. I try so hard to rap like Confucius, but it just brings on more confusion. Mental intrusion, brain cells are using, I meant being used by you. Don't it feel good to think like God made our brains to?. I'm not saying that thinking isn't done by you. I'm just implying that today's music turn it into something that we ain't used to. And so here I am giving you my lyrical loot, now let your earsophogous digest this lyrical fruit. [Hook: Z.E.K.E]. Picked this fresh off the fruit tree. Survive in the woods on these berries. In through your ears down to your sole, feet. Let it soak in, soak in, soak in. Filled with juices and great seed. Better than any smoke from any weed. How about eating something that the body needs?. The truth's been spoken, spoken, spoken. . [Verse 2: Z.E.K.E]. There's apples, pears, bananas, oranges, durians, strawberries, melons, honeydew, cantaloupe, and many more. But if I list them all, we'd be here forever. So I'll only list a few, but I guess I can list some of the wonders of fruit. You know about ebola, cancer, and chlamydia. Did you know eating fruit helps in preventing them?. I'm starting to sound like Mr. Rogers in the neighborhood, remove neighbor, Falling out Depression and F.O.O.D. is the trailer. Park it in the spot, but not from the third to the fourth. Or anywhere in Lew., you'll find yourself in court, by the way they can help you on any court and any sport. Help you perform when she removes her Jansport. He never said that this rated PG, fruit is intercourse. . [Hook: Z.E.K.E]. . [Verse 3: Z.E.K.E]. My words aren't for the faint of heart, my words for the groups at Saint Martin, my own words. It's another moral lesson about the Industry, but not this time around. F.O.O.D. starting to move up the food pyramid but now we moving down, well now, that I think about it. I'm changing up my thesis, I listen to the playback and hear me praising fruit for all the wrong reasons. Sounds like why they all be clapping, not the Ernie or Burt version. This ain't no diss E, just Versatile Verses, fruit removing curses, from the Industry. Can I abuse my creative license since I'm lacking my driving one. But I got the Eye of Tiger Woods, son. So I'm driving this one way down the fairway. Bump this in the car or when you're having a bad hair day. [Hook: Z.E.K.E]. . [Bridge: Z.E.K.E]. This that, that that, that fruit that x3.

My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. . [Verse 1: Tyga]. Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim. My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless. Five girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists. Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians. God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go. I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road. I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne. I would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe. Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us. Saying they all different but I don’t show them no effort. Underestimated that R8 then I tested. Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it. I’m blessed-ed, cross-sign baptism, West shit. Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong. Go against a bull nigga head on. I'm too strong, eight arms, ticking to a bomb. Army stance, ready for war. We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor. Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored. They say my music knocks so I hope it open every door. [Chorus: Tyga]. We all dream one day we kings and queens. We all dream one day we be kings and queens. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. We all dream one day we kings and queens. We all dream one day we be kings and queens. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, young.... . [Verse 2: Wale]. Uhh, never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest. And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath. Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best. Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death. We ain't cool with all of these niggas, I'm through with all of these niggas. You fool with all of these niggas, you lose like all of these (niggas). Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits. Anybody riding with young'un will probably recoup. Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics. Finna be king but I’m way too proud to offer as minion. I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga. And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions. I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches. Double MG, YMCMB cause we run this, you dig?. We all kings, give anything to my soft queens. I’m lost without them, when they around, I am Charles Sheen. Ralph.... [Chorus: Tyga]. We all dream one day we kings and queens. We all dream one day we be kings and queens. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. We all dream one day we kings and queens. We all dream one day we be kings and queens. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream. . [Verse 3: Nas]. Uhh.. yeah, yeah. You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric. Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected. I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit. Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip. Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip. Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit. I seem to love these whips. A white Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit. At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz. That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball. See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home. College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom. Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang. Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing. So that make you a queen, surviving anything. Escobar season begins so let the semis ring. Pimp of the year, I could smack your father. Not only with my hand but with a black revolver. I been in pressed silk since breast milk. Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga3Embed",INFP

We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down. By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow. When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind. Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine. They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice. And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied. . [Pre-Chorus]. You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin'). To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin'). But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser. [Chorus]. So I hope I learn to get over myself. Stop tryin' to be somebody else. So we can love each other for free. Everybody wants somethin', you just want me. . [Verse 2]. Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?. Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?. In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to. 'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true. . [Pre-Chorus]. You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried). High tides (High tides, high tides). 'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh. . [Chorus]. So I hope I learn to get over myself. Stop tryin' to be somebody else. Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free. Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me. . [Bridge]. Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get. You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left. Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time). We both will find (We both find) peace of mind. Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind. [Chorus]. Well, I hope I learn to get over myself. Stop tryin' to be somebody else. Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah. 'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me. . [Refrain]. You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin'). To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin'). But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser. . [Outro]. The only regret I have. I wish that it was just at a different time. A most turbulent period of my life. Why would I put that on you?. That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about. But because of that period of time. Even though it was so much fun.

Taught me how to build a fire and to spread The Word. In the evening, everybody went to worship and weep. Hands above our heads, reaching for God. Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed. You were waiting for a revelation of your own. Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut. Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart. Waiting to be tasted and ultimately wasted. You were gonna win me over from the start. . [Chorus]. Your poetry was so bad. It took a lot to not laugh. You say that I showed you the light. But all it did, in the end. Was make the dark feel darker than before. . [Verse 2]. Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason. Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason. When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason. You are not convinced the reason is a good one. . While you're going to sleep, your mind keeps you awake. And it makes your heart beat fast and loud. There's nothing you can do, but the only thing you've found:. Playing Slayer at full volume helps to drown it out. . [Chorus]. Your poetry was so bad. It took a lot to not laugh. You say that I showed you the light. But all it did, in the end. Was make the dark feel darker than before. Dark feel darker than before.

I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys. You knowin' how it be when you start living large. I control my own life, Charles was never in charge. No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram. Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom. On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind. Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?. She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself. ""Why he by himself?"". He got two older brothers; one hood, one good. An independent older sister kept me fly when she could.

Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck. It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked. So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound. My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon. I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún. Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon. So it's more than right I try and shed some light on a man.

If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass. Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam. Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck. Hope I really get to see 30. Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty. Most of the clean faces be the most dirty. I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry. Ass all chunky, brain is insanity. Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree. And I get both, never truly satisfied. I am happy, that's just the saddest lie. . [Chorus]. I've got some issues that nobody can see. And all of these emotions are pouring out of me. I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right. This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life. . [Outro].

They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?. I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me. They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks. Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box. They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake. Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake.

The people always different but it always feels the same. That's the real me, pop the champagne. The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain. . [Chorus]. Stayin' still, eyes closed. Let the world just pass me by. Pain pills, nice clothes. If I fall, I think I'll fly. Touch me, Midas. Make me part of your design. None to guide us. I feel fear for the very last time. . [Verse 2]. They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head. I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said. They tell me I’m so humble, I say I'm turning red.

They tell me I'm a God, I'm lost in the facade. Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd. No matter what I make, they never see mistakes. Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake. They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above. The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love. [Pre-Chorus 2]. Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?. When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch. Is there a real me? Pop the champagne. It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain. .

I feel fear for the very last time. . [Outro]. Lay still, restless. Losing sleep while I lose my mind (Yeah). All thrill, no stress. All my muses left behind (Left behind). World is, below.

I just wanna try something, try something new. Even if it doesn't mean that I'm good to you. . [Chorus]. (I just wanna) all the pressure. All the madness, going through my head. Try to focus, I can't help it. Put it on you instead. Slow down. Slow down. I just wanna take the pressure. And then send it swimming through my head. Try to focus, I can't help but put it on you instead. Slow down. Slow down. I just wanna-. [Verse 1]. Pick up the phone. I've been callin' but it seems nobody's home now (right now). I feel alone if you listen you can hear it in my tone now (right now). But you prayed for me- when I felt tired and when I called out you were right there. Yeah you prayed for me- when I got stressed out and felt like no one was around. Yeah you prayed for me. . [Chorus]. (i just wanna) all the pressure. All the madness, going through my head. Try to focus, I can't help it. Put it on you instead. Slow down. Slow down. I just wanna-. . [Verse 2]. Every time I reach out I feel like I don't get an answer right away (no-o-o). I know it's foolish of me to think that everyone else should have the words to say. Slow down- you're stuck in your own head now. Slow down- I can't get out of bed now.

Holding shit together so you know I try. I'm moving so slow no I thought I'd feel better. Only been a month but it's taking forever. I don't really know if I thought I'd feel better. You don't really know me so you wouldn't mind. . [Chorus]. Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't). The middle of the summer here I am, we're still.

The middle of the summer here I am, we're still. I don't think you know me like you thought you did back then. Back then, you knew me but right now you just don't. You just don't. [Verse 2]. People change and it's got me feeling stressed out. Kind of strange that there's nothing we can talk about. That's why they say, maybe reasons that were left out. You don't really notice like I thought you did. . [Chorus]. Oh, you thought you knew me like that, but you (Don't). The middle of the summer here I am, we're still.

Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword. So I’m sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce. Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours. Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor. Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war. Guessed, but I’m pretty sure that I’m destined to endure. Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore. World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace. What’s behind the door the allure something strange?. Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed. No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change. Course is unphased, contorted or concave. I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang. Got me feeling like. [Hook: Akon].

Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help. So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real. So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield. Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal. When friends become foes know you're doing it well. Just keep it going. I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?. Group homes and tombstones to feel safer. Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying. Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in. Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it. Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it. Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is. Way I play the game, no wonder the brother made it like. [Hook: Akon].

I can't complain, okay I lied, I could look maybe if I tried. Feel like I could just lie down here on the street and I'd be content. I feel tired now but I feel wired later on in my bed. Feel like I have just been living in my head. So I've been paying double rent. I feel like cleaning up this clutter and this mess. Feel like doing gateway drugs while I am sitting on the fence. I feel I've woven my regrets into a nest, but I digress. I feel all right! I'm feeling better than before. If this talk was any smaller it won't fit me anymore. Yeah I feel fine, got everything I didn't want. I got paid, I got my fucking name in slightly bigger font. I feel I blinked and thirty years just came and went. Shit when they asked me what I'd like to be I shoulda said content. I feel finer than a speck of dust but no one here relates. 'Cause when I ask 'em how they are they always say all right. I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine all right, all right I'm fine I'm fine o-okay. Is that all you want me to say? I'm so bored it's always the same. What's the point of talking that way when your story's all on your face?. Hide that real portrait away, yeah good morning Dorian Grey. I feel like—I feel like you are so consistent.

Sitting on my rooftop long after the sun has set. Bits of moon scattered like some trinkets in the darkness. There just ain't nobody like me and I feel like I just can't connect. So I just wanna run away just like my fucking father did. Or slip inside my head to find the city where nobody lives. No friendly charlatans, no bitter glass of fake champagne. To gargle, rinse, and spit back at those two-face little Harvey Dents. That smell of sulfur every time a rapper gets it in their head. That they are dope as hell boy, I am unconvinced. But I digress, how am I? Fine I guess. If you wanted me to answer fine then why the fuck you askin' then?. [Chorus: Styalz Fuego]. Tell me what you need. Tell me how you are. Hold that thought.

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested. Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent. Truly I ain't got no business here. But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it. But really I would rather be at home all by myself. Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being. I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend. So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party. I'll be here, somewhere in the corner. Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'. I can hardly hear. Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you. So, tell my friends that I'll be over here. [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?.

An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this. And I know you mean only the best. And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be. Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to. Some music with a message, like we usually do. And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet. So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here. Not there in the kitchen. With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends. So, tell them I'll be here. Right next to the boy who's throwin' up. 'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more. Oh God, why am I here?. . [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here.

I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'. And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way. So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready.

Who walk around bumpin' Raw with the shit blarin'. Saying ""Fuck school!"" and droppin' out like a miscarriage. I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed. I played a part in this devilish game. Makin' your common sense perish. But I ain't takin' the full blame. 'Cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents. All of your brain cells rottin' from weed. You feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete. You havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see. With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat. But still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be. Without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep. Makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean. While your favorite rapper's like, ""Yeah, he got it from me"". You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'. When I say the word ""fun,"" what do you envision?. Prolly drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'. With clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition. Is that all you think life really is?. Well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot. I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it. Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain — give me it!. Do you even have any goals. Aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?. Well, let me guess — no. You're only in school because your parents make you go. When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros. Yo, society's got you livin' for a wack cause. You're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all. You don't read any books or play ball. You don't draw — you literally do nothing at all!. Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits. You don't have, 'cause you idolize rappers that do. And all they say is, ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof"". And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?. How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor. You pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later. Then you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered. Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?. You wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older. And regret it all 'cause you can't provide. Your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised. Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice. [Verse 2]. Girls, stop actin' like you want a guy. With traits like Romeo — bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!. You always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it. And you want somethin' real — shut up, tramp, save it!. Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets. And head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'. Pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'. 'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station. One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it. But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement. You want Romeo, then act patient. And stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'. It's the club, where guys put on a new persona. After they get loaded with a few Corona's. They always shoutin' and wild out. With habits that very few condone of. Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em. Then when they leave you, you cry and cry. Talkin' about, ""Oh my god, I can't find a guy!. I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!. Why am I even on Earth? I should die!"". You want Romeo, you're not worthy. You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes. Sometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'. Try a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'. [Verse 3]. The term ""real nigga"" is publicly used. And I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused. Are you one for always bustin' your tool. With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove. To homies up in your crew?. Is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot. And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed. Like it's fun to be you?. But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?. Nah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop. Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?. 'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal. It's clear you can't stand the law. You're lost as an abandoned dog. And all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball. I can't even fuck with you. 'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too. You'll get old and be nothin'. Livin' life in these streets, thuggin'. And starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'. Look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool. Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you. 'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through. Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move. Your ""real nigga"" talk seems bogus. A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it. And his future doesn't seem hopeless. A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused. [Verse 4]. To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong. You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song. You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums. See, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums. Hope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue. The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong. All you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese. And the mass-control limit was breached — fuck hip-hop!. They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see. They purposely makin' the innocent weak. My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me. Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time. It is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine. I can guide you if you feel blind. I just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind260Embed",ENTJ

It's taken this long to shake last year's come down. Forget the past, as soon as December starts. Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don’t get in last.

Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bag (That's right). Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans. It doesn’t matter, everybody has their secret plan. Once you're through, start picking your spot. Unpack and realise all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost. (Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks). And dudes are too excited, already sitting there sloshed. You know it doesn’t take long. Before you find somebody blazing up. ""Mate, what are you doing?. I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd!"". And it's always the cheap fuckers who ain’t paid enough. But please note that we don’t condone taking drugs. [Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]. Summer days, summer days. Oh, summer days, summer days. I love summer days. I love summer days. . [Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]. ""Man, how cold is it inside this tent?!"". ""I know, it's freezing, man, Jesus Christ"". . [Verse 3: PEZ & 360]. Now as soon as the sun rises you’ll be ready to start. At six o’clock, standing there outside your tent with a glass. You're in it for the long haul, it doesn’t end when it's dark. We all know you’ve got your friends to make your energy last. And you gotta time it so you're peaking while the acts play. Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into backstage. (Man, let's just do it, who cares?). If you get caught by police then try to act straight. ""Nah, they're not those pills, I need 'em for my back pain"". And dudes are flying, saying to their mates, ""I love you, man!"". Or on a walk so they can go. And call their mum and dad (That's PEZ). And then there’s people who so desperately just need a friend. They're going up to anybody, tryna have a D&M (Yeah, my family). The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live. You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite. Gettin' wasted while you bake in the sun. What can I say, yo? It's a fuckin' good way to get drunk. [Chorus: Pez & Hailey Cramer]. I love summer days, summer days. Oh, summer days, summer days. I love summer days. I love summer days. . [Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]. ""Hey, what happened to you guys last night?"". ""I didn't even hear the countdown or anything"". . [Verse 4: PEZ]. Now by the last day you're probably thinkin' summer's the worst. 'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns. And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse. And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts. All you wanna do is sleep but you got packin' to do. Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue. Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends. But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again. . [Chorus: PEZ & Hailey Cramer]. I love summer days, summer days. Oh, summer days, summer days. I love summer days. I love summer days. I love summer days, summer days. Summer days. Summer days. I love summer days. Summer days. Summer days. I love summer days. . [Ad-Libs/Collision: PEZ]. I was gonna say I love festivals. Didn't really have the same ring to it though. Yeah. PEZ, 360. Of course Matik on the beat. Yeah. Play that shit loudEmbed",ENTJ
857,857,Trans Am - I Want It All,"My Insanity Lyrics[Verse 1]. In my mind the feeling’s fine. Got so fucking used to feeling like dying. Feeling tipsy, keep filling this whisky. Been 2 days and no one seems to miss me. This just might be the best ending. Gawd, maybe this will work. This should work, my dreams won’t work. Numb the feelings or just numbed all of the hurt. What do you know about this feeling?. What do you know?. You’re so perfect in you pearly world. Appealing not just me but everyone that loved me. It’s funny? I don’t see what’s so funny. But I’ve been thinking and it seems to be. Anything I want to be. Well, I’mma make them laugh. Make them cry, make them live. Make them die. [Verse 2]. Six paranoid wishes got me. Feeling all distant from these. Supposed to be helping, they. Make everything worse to think. Come together, my girl. Temptation smiles, girl. A beautiful mind. Beatle filled line. See my premonition spread its wings. And sings and the little children sleep. Kool-Aid spills on every little thing. And listen, they pay attention. Finally listens, finally mentions. The who I am, a God, I stand. . In my mind (fade). . [Verse 3]. Time to take it to another level. If you dancing with me. Then with the devil. Hell razor. Stunting hard in the church with the blazer. Show me the best and I’ll replace him with an eraser. Disgrace is the human race. So I trans to a different race. I’m from another place where they. Take bitch hating ass niggas to maze. Only way they’ll make it out is through a pit. Watch me spit blaze.... [Verse 4]. Uh, and I ain’t got nothing but stacks of time. Uh, so watch me raise the death to life. Uh, a mad scientist with fucking gifts. Something like Frankenstein when I cross the lines. Uh, genius to insanity, just to do for the sake of vanity. So if you’re the best that we’ve seen. You don’t see me. As I grab for the shit that you don’t see. I’m the shit, but you stink. You remind me of what I want to be if I kill my dream. But shiny all appeal to me. You’re gonna kill the whole world just to get to me. Don’t give a damn, don’t give a fuck. Roll up in a pint, girl what’s up. Do this shit long enough and like a plane. All these bitches will all be are ready to take off. Jack’City, not the New Jack. Raising the stats by day, killing bitches when the night pass. The new drug when you partied last. The charts will all know that. When we finally depart at last. Got the past behind us. Looking for the future now. Moving fast like the cop’s behind us. Your hate is fuel for my ammunition. Your girl should tell you it ain’t rape if she gave permission. And I got a lot off issues, to tell the truth. So I put in my music to annoy you. You’re going to know me, and take a trip through my brain. With all the rain clouds that fast lane. But there will be change like I robbed a bank. And bring the pain like I cut a vein. My thoughts are heavy when I see the box chevy. The weight of raw gravity likes to weigh down on me. Uh, and I want it all. Bad broads, vast cribs, large crowds, and the fastest cars. [Verse 5]. Uh, but maybe I’m crazy. Doing the same shit and think I’ll be Jay-Z. Can’t be lazy when you chasing a dream. Keep the steam burning like you’re ‘bout to change the scene. Uh, love me now before it’s all over. Uh, love me here so I can the soldiers. [2X]Embed",ENTJ

Is tell a little lie. Hold that thought. And just keep on telling me you're fine. . [Verse 1: Seth Sentry]. How am I? I feel good, I feel all right. I can't complain, okay I lied, I could look maybe if I tried. Feel like I could just lie down here on the street and I'd be content. I feel tired now but I feel wired later on in my bed. Feel like I have just been living in my head. So I've been paying double rent. I feel like cleaning up this clutter and this mess. Feel like doing gateway drugs while I am sitting on the fence. I feel I've woven my regrets into a nest, but I digress. I feel all right! I'm feeling better than before. If this talk was any smaller it won't fit me anymore. Yeah I feel fine, got everything I didn't want. I got paid, I got my fucking name in slightly bigger font. I feel I blinked and thirty years just came and went. Shit when they asked me what I'd like to be I shoulda said content. I feel finer than a speck of dust but no one here relates. 'Cause when I ask 'em how they are they always say all right. I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine all right, all right I'm fine I'm fine o-okay. Is that all you want me to say? I'm so bored it's always the same. What's the point of talking that way when your story's all on your face?. Hide that real portrait away, yeah good morning Dorian Grey. I feel like—I feel like you are so consistent. I feel like you should probly whisper me the trick to it. 'Cause I could go and change completely in an instant. I'm weak, but I'm powerful, I'm fine thanks, how are you?. [Chorus: Styalz Fuego]. Tell me what you need. Tell me how you are. Hold that thought. And just keep on telling me you're fine. All we gotta do. Is tell a little lie. Hold that thought. And just keep on telling me you're fine. . [Verse 2: Seth Sentry]. So how am I? Marvellous. I'm glad you interrupted me to ask me this. Nah I've been a motherfucking basketcase. I hate love, I'm done with it, I'll never break a heart again. I'm sorry. I'm worried that I'm dumb and no-one's told me yet. Drugs and drunkenness, I've gone little Hunter S. Sitting on my rooftop long after the sun has set. Bits of moon scattered like some trinkets in the darkness. There just ain't nobody like me and I feel like I just can't connect. So I just wanna run away just like my fucking father did. Or slip inside my head to find the city where nobody lives. No friendly charlatans, no bitter glass of fake champagne. To gargle, rinse, and spit back at those two-face little Harvey Dents. That smell of sulfur every time a rapper gets it in their head. That they are dope as hell boy, I am unconvinced. But I digress, how am I? Fine I guess. If you wanted me to answer fine then why the fuck you askin' then?. [Chorus: Styalz Fuego]. Tell me what you need. Tell me how you are. Hold that thought.

Now that the business is out of the way, we can eat and enjoy ourselves, eh? How are things? Just fine.. . JAMES. Something you need to know. Hmm? We got hit last night.. . LOBOS. So I heard. Did you catch this man?. . TOMMY. We got him.. . JAMES. He knew who to hit, where and when. So until we know how he got his information, we're exposed.. . LOBOS. Oh, so he didn't talk?. . TOMMY. Unfortunately for him.. . LOBOS. Unfortunately for you. You took your men off the street.. . TOMMY. Had to.. . JAMES. No choice.. . LOBOS. You're losing about $25,000 an hour. It's good to see that you knew enough not to let it affect our pay schedule. When I hired you six months ago to be my New York distributor, you guaranteed me a certain level of professionalism. You told me that the Kings, the Bloods, the DDP, that none of them were worth my time. I believe the exact words were, ""They're gangs. And we're a business."" Hmm? You also told me that only you could guarantee me a safe and secure pipeline - with no interruptions.. . TOMMY. Come on, Lobos. You know in this business, there's no guarantees.. . JAMES. We have a plan to fix this situation.. . LOBOS. Then you don't have time for lunch. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Anta [Halts Ghost from leaving]. Tommy leaves the room and they converse in Spanish].. Translation:. . LOBOS. You know, I checked out. Your name is feared on the streets.. If you get the situation under control you could have your own Cartel one day. Understand.. JAMES. Yes.. LOBOS. You live in the country side, take up watercolors while your men take all the risk. You do business two, three days a year. You don't, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. And then, what use will I have for you?. JAMES. We’ll get it done.. LOBOS. Yes, you will.. . JAME. Goodbye, boss. . LOBOS. Goodbye Ghost. [Ghost leaves] Call the pilot, we’re not leaving tonight.. . JAMES. I'll go see Ruiz. You get Anibal and Rolla, deal?. . TOMMY. Yeah.. . JAMES. See you tonight. And watch your back.. . TOMMY. You too, motherfucker. Full detail, right? Even the trunk?. . ?. Especially the trunk.. . TOMMY. Good. I hate the smell of blood.[Tommy goes to see Anibal at a cookout.]. . ANIBAL. Thomas! [Sends everyone away] Where’s ghost?. . TOMMY. He sends his regards. . ANIBAL. You play Dominoes?. . TOMMY. This is not a social visit, Anibal. We got hit last night.. . ANIBAL. My bad, I ain't hear that.. . TOMMY. Not a word?. . ANIBAL. Nada.. . TOMMY. Yeah, well, a score like that somebody will brag about. You’ll hear something. Fifty stakes. Seventy-five if you bring him back alive.. . ANIBAL. Means that much to you? If it's one of your men, you can kill him yourself. We just want to watch.[James meets Ruiz in the park.]. . RUIZ. If I knew who ordered it, yeah, they'd be dead already.. . JAMES. What? What?. . RUIZ. We got hit too. My money guy, same as yours. They shot my boy, Angel. They shot himin the back of the head. Had a baby on the way.. . JAMES. That's fucked up.. . RUIZ. Okay, look. I know, okay, you work with other crews.  But we got to dead this.You have to stop this before it goes any further. I could lend you men, extra protection.. . JAMES. Nah, if they know we ride together, I lose trust of the Tainos and Rock Street.. . RUIZ. Can’t trust them anyway. . JAMES. Tommy and I are neutral. Tu sabes eso, papa. Come on.. . RUIZ. Bueno. Maybe there's something else that we could work out.[Agent Juan Julio Medina watches Lobos in his car from a distance.][GHOST’S KITCHEN]. . RAINA. It's the lead, uncle Tommy. If I get it, it'll be like a huge deal. 'Cause I'm only in the fifth grade.. . TOMMY. I'm sure you got the best singing voice in the whole place, baby girl.. . RAINA. When are you gonna stop calling me that? I'm not the baby anymore. Jasmine is.. I was there when you were born.. . TOMMY. You'll always be baby girl to me.. . ESTELLE. To all of us, baby girl.. . TASHA. Tommy, have some more chicken.. . TOMMY. Mmm, oh. Mmm. Thanks, T.. . TASHA. You know, if you meet a girl who can cook, I bet we'd never see you again.. [. TOMMY. Laughs] No way that'll ever happen. I gotta come over here and school Tariq in Call of Duty.. . TARIQ. Yeah, right, uncle Tommy.. . JAMES. Yeah, right. ‘Cause you know you're not supposed to be playing those games anyway.. . TOMMY. Oh, my bad.. . RAINA. Stars for my little star. Keep working hard on that audition.. . JAMES. Hey.. . RAINA. Wait, daddy. Are these real diamonds?. . JAMES. [Laughs] What you think, huh?. . TASHA. If you keep this up, you're gonna spoil her rotten.. . JAMES. And you don't complain when I do it to you. [Slaps her butt] Fix me a plate, okay? Tommy and I gonna talk in the office. We got work to do.. . ESTELLE. Let me see them diamonds, baby girl.. . JAMES. Soldado Nation got hit too.. . TOMMY. No shit.. . JAMES. Ruiz got a full shipment of weapons from his Florida connect last week. Our drivers can have full use till the shit blows over or until we catch the motherfucker. He offered to have his people ride with ours.. . TOMMY. Fuck that.. . JAMES. Fuck that. The guns, though, that could work. I know you don't like it. Police stop a driver carrying recreational weight and some cash, Tommy, that's one thing. But a gun in the car, you're looking at intent to distribute, plus the weapons charge. Kanan got what 15 years?. . TOMMY. You got a better idea? 'Cause we gotta open up the store or Lobos will move on. Not to mention our people are off the clock, and our customers will find new places to cop.. . JAMES. Let's say we find the motherfucker. And it is one of Anibal's people or Rock Street Killahz or whoever.Then what?. . TOMMY. Then it's on. Then we take down the whole fucking crew. We show them. We show everybody. You can't fuck with us, like the old days before Kanan went inside.. . JAMES. We were young then. Mobile. I got too much shit going on now to go into hiding.. The kids. The club.. . . TOMMY. Oh, wait, so now the club dictates what we do with the real business instead of the other way around? And we opened up the laundromats to clean the money. I was fine with that. But then you said, ""let's open up a nightclub. So we can hide even more.” So I agreed to hide the money. Period.. . JAMES. What if there could be more than that though, man? What if it's our retirement plan?. . TOMMY. You mean we grow up, go legit, live happily ever after? [Laughs] I'm sor - [Laughing]. We've been hustling together our whole lives. I love this shit and so do you. Focus up. I say we take Ruiz up on his offer. We put the boys back on the street, and if anyone steps, they light that motherfucker up. Agreed?. . JAMES. Yeah.. . TOMMY. We'll go out and get the guns from Ruiz tonight. I'll set it up. Go without me. Take Julio. I gotta handle a few things at the club. You want a place to clean our money long-term, it's gotta stay open, right?. . TOMMY. Now that's the motherfucking hustler I know talking.[Tasha and Ghost’s bathroom.]. . JAMES. I'll see you at the club later. I'm going now. Gotta make sure everything's settled for tonight.. . TASHA. Can't that new white boy do that? You pay him enough.. . JAMES. It's a business, baby. It needs attention 24/7.. . . TASHA. So do I. Ghost, what's up? You and Tommy behind closed doors, you running around with this club.. We okay?. . JAMES. When we met, what'd you think I was gonna be? Hmm?. . TASHA. The biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.. JAMES. You never thought about more?. . . TASHA. What more? You talking about the club as more? I saw the money you made last night. That's not more, it's less. You are the best at what you do. We have everything. I just want it to stay this way. What?. . JAMES. When you come to the club tonight, you need to look like you own the place, not like you trying to get in for free. Wear that purple dress I got you last month. But, baby, I like this dress. I'll send Shawn back, give you time to change.[“Ohh Shh” plays by Chris Lake and then switches to “Own It” by Mack Wilds]. . TASHA. Have you seen my husband?. . GUARD. Anybody got eyes on the boss? The boss is prepping the DJ now. I'll take you upstairs.. . TASHA. I know where he'll get to me a little sooner. Hey. Mwah.. . JAMES. What's up?. . KANTOS. The DJ brought backup dancers who are not in the contract.. . JAMES. Well, we got extra spotlights on hand? We could find them. Have the guys put them up.. . JAMES. [Spots Angie from a balcony and heads downstairs.] Angie!. . ANGELA. Jamie. . JAMES. Angela Valdes. How long has it been?. . ANGELA. I don't know. Almost, Jesus, 18 years.. JAMES. You look the same.. . ANGELA. [Laughs] Well, that's proof we've gotten older. Your eyesight's going.. . JAMES. [Laughs] My eyes work just fine. What have you been doing?. . ANGELA. For 18 years? Not sure there's a short answer.. Choate, college, law school…. . JAMES. law school? Okay, big-time.. . ANGELA. Stop it. I'm still the same ""round the way"" girl I always was.. . JAMES. Same girl, huh? Not exactly. I don't remember that dress.. . ANGELA. Well, I don't remember that suit either, uptown. What have you been up to, Jamie? What have you been doing all these years?. . GUARD. Boss, the new DJ's gonna start.. . ANGELA. Wait, did he just call you ""boss""?. . JAMES. I own this place.. . GUARD. Kantos said he needs to talk to you now.. . JAMES. All right. Um - Sorry, I gotta - You got a nightclub to run.. . ANGELA. I get it. You deserve this crown we got it sewn up because we own it it was good to see you.. . ANGELA. You too.. . [They give each other a big hug]. . JAMES. Okay. [Walks away and then comes back] You know what, give me your number. I ain’t gonna let you get away that easy. I’ll call you.. . ANGELA. Okay. . KANTOS. Mrs. St. Patrick, you're not leaving, are you? The new DJ starts in a few minutes, and I'm sure the boss wants you to be here.. . TASHA. Shawn, meet me out front. I'm leaving. [“I’m Good” by Lenisha Nelson is playing when Tasha enters the backseat of the car. Tasha rolls down the driver/passenger partition window in the limo. She puts on a show for Shawn.]RUIZ. Quien es todo?. . PONCHO. Yeah big shipment this time. Esto limpio. . RUIZ. Bueno.. NOMAR. We're really giving this away for free?. RUIZ. This time. When we get there, you stay in the car. Me and Poncho will handle the drop.. . NOMAR. I set up the meeting with the guy you asked.. . RUIZ. Good.. . LILIANA. Papi. Can I go to the movies with Rocio and Lara tomorrow after school Be home by dinner, so I can take you to your mom's, okay?. . LILIAN. Alright. . RUIZ. Now get inside before you catch a cold. . LILIAN. Okay, Pa.. . RUIZ. Vamonos. Let's go, we're late.JAMES. Julio tell them to check the guns?. TOMMY. First thing I said to him. Think it bothers them they don't know who they're working for?. JAMES. You think the fry cook at burger king knows the fucking CEO? They wouldn't know that motherfucker if he walked in and asked for extra ketchup. Don't forget.. . TOMMY. One of these people might be the reason Cruz got jumped in the first place. Yeah, well, let's hope he or she is afraid to get shot.. . JAMES. We'll know soon enough.. . TOMMY. Our soldiers are strapped now. We should be too. All this shit going on, how am I gonna explain to Tasha I let you run around with no piece?. . JAMES. Let's get 'em out on the street. Time to make the doughnuts.ANGELA. Not bad for 18 years later. Greg.. . GREG. Hey, sleepyhead. You missed our run this morning. When you didn't show up and you didn't answer your cell, I thought maybe something was wrong.. ANGELA. Shit. Sorry.. . GREG. Got here and you were in the shower, so I thought I'd grab breakfast.. . ANGELA. Greg, I thought we said the key was just for emergencies. Which this could've been. This just feels a little - you don't need to check on me.. . GREG. Come on, Angela, I think most women would be happy to know that someone's looking out for them.. . ANGELA. You're right. I'm sorry. You just startled me is all. Thank you.. . GREG. [Phone vibrates] I gotta go. See you later.JAMES. Angela Valdes came into the club last night.. . TOMMY. From high school? Wow. What's that?. . JAMES. Eighteen years.. . TOMMY. How'd she look?. . JAMES. Mm.. . TOMMY. That good, huh? She married now, she got kids?. . JAMES. No ring, didn't say nothing about kids.. . TOMMY. You tell her about yours?. . JAMES. Well, we didn't talk that long.. . TOMMY. Oh, shit.. . JAMES. What's that supposed to mean?. . TOMMY. What that means is what are you thinking about doing? When that girl moved away, she seriously fucked you up. I was there, remember?. . JAMES. Aw, come on. That was a long time ago.. . TOMMY. Well, Tasha's a good woman, man. You ain't never fucked around on her before. Why do you want to go sniffing around pussy from high school?. . JAMES. Tommy, first of all, I can't believe you starting some shit about monogamy. You got more bitches than a goddamn pound, but second, I know me and Tasha got a good thing. I'm not trying to fuck that up. It's just got me thinking, you know, about the road not traveled, that's all.. . TOMMY. ""The road not traveled""? You are a rich, successful motherfucker. What more do you want?. . JAMES. I want to see how Angela turned out.. . TOMMY. No, you already saw how she turned out. Anything else is just you trying to heal wounds from childhood.. . JAMES. You gotta stop watching that Dr. Phil shit.. . TOMMY. That man knows what he's talking about.. . JAMES. Shut up.. . . TOMMY. Sit down. You shut up.. . JAMES. No, shut up. So long, motherfucker.. . TOMMY. You didn't ask about that thing we did the other night.. . JAMES. You clean it up like I said? Then there ain't nothing to ask about. What, you think I forgot?. . TOMMY. Yeah, I do.. . JAMES. Get the fuck out of here.. . LAKEISHA. Can I borrow this?. . TASHA. No way, girl. That's new. But the Gucci, you can have that.. . LAKEISHA. Damn, girl. Ghost keeps you laced. Yo, I don't care. I'll take your hand-me-downs as long as you're giving them out. So this is what happily ever after looks like. You hit the lottery, girl. Niggas ain't getting married like that, and certainly not rich niggas.. . TASHA. He wasn't rich when I met him. Hmm. You know, Keisha, clothes and bags are nice, but there are some things about ghost you can't see.. . LAKEISHA. You don't gotta play modest with me, Tasha.. . TASHA. I'm not playing modest.. . LAKEISHA. I'm not gonna die of jealousy over here, especially if you're through with these boots. Hold up, what size you wear again? You know I don't get all this European shit.. . TASHA.

Excuse me. You are Carlos “Vibora” Ruiz. . RUIZ. Felipe Lobos I thought you were a bedtime story.. . LOBOS. Aren’t you a cliché. . RUIZ. You said you are having problems with your current distributors. . LOBOS. He is not as reliable as I was led to believe.. . RUIZ. So you call Puerto Ricans? You’re the first Mexican I’ve known to do that. Forgive my surprise.. . LOBOS. I do business with niggers. At least you and I speak the same language. I don’t care who your mother fucked. I want to make money.. . RUIZ. Bueno. Should we make business then?. . LOBOS. Bueno.[Hip-hop music playing from headphones and a pick up is made.]ANGELA. New York's so different now. Citi bikes, no cars in Times Square. White people living uptown.. . JAMES. [Laughter] You been gone a minute.. . ANGELA. Mm. You finally got your nightclub. Your dad would've been proud.. . JAMES. I told you about my father's nightclub? He lost the place before we met. I didn't remember I told you that.. . ANGELA. I think we told each other everything back then.. . JAMES. Hmm.. . ANGELA. The last time we had lunch, I'm pretty sure there was no linen tablecloths.. . JAMES. I don't think we had chairs.. . JAMES. We grabbed a slice at the counter at Ray's on Sutphin.. . ANGELA.

I almost missed my train.. . JAMES. That was the idea. That was the idea.. . ANGELA. Choate was the opportunity of a lifetime. But that doesn't mean it was easy to go. Jamie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left the way I did.. . ANGELA. Your parents made you go.. . JAMES. But I didn't fight them. You said you'd be back for Christmas.. . ANGELA. My family moved to Sunnyside after I left.. . JAMES. I had the same number. But you were just [Whoosh] Gone. And then when my pops died, I thought then, at least, you would reach out.. . ANGELA. I should've been there for you. But I just knew that if I called, if I heard your voice, I would go back.. I would've dropped everything for you. Everything my parents worked for, everything I'd worked for So I made a choice.. . JAMES. I wouldn't have asked you to come back. You didn't belong in the hood.. . ANGELA. Neither did you.. . JAMES. Ah.. . ANGELA. But now we're both out, just like we always planned.. . JAMES. Not exactly how we planned.. . ANGELA. Oh, shit.. . JAMES. What?. . ANGELA. I gotta go.. JAMES. Now?. . ANGELA. I gotta get back to the office.. . JAMES. All right.. . ANGELA. Thanks for lunch.. .

Don't fill out the total.. . KANTOS. Why not?. . TOMMY. I'm gonna confirm your count at the bank. I'll take that.. . KANTOS. Every club I've ever managed, I always do the deposit.. . TOMMY. There's a first time for everything. Deposit slip?. . KANTOS. I already signed it. Want a fresh one?. . TOMMY. Nah, I'm sure yours will turn out fine. Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.. . KANTOS. Hey, about that boss never told me how you found out about that.. . TOMMY. None of your fucking business how we know. As long as you work for us, this is how it goes. We don't have a problem, do we?. . KANTOS. No, we don't.FRANKIE. [Laughs] Was just about to send out a search party for you. You're never late.. . ANGELA. I know. Sorry. Lunch ran long. Frankie, I know you went out on a limb for me. I'm not gonna blow it.. . FRANKIE. If you do, it's both our asses.. . SAXE. Congrats on the promotion, Valdes.. . ANGELA. Thanks, Saxe. You're on this now?. . GREAG. Just got assigned. If I request reassignment, they're gonna ask why.. . FRANKIE. I'm Francesca Lavarro, chief of criminal division along with my deputy, A.U.S.A. Angela Valdes. I'll be leading this task force. Our goal is the prosecution of one of the most notorious drug traffickers in our hemisphere, Mexican national Felipe Lobos. Lobos's brutality and vicious nature are well documented. For everyone's safety, please remember the task force is top secret. And no one, not even your families, can know the name of the target of this investigation. Agent medina, can you please bring everybody up to speed on Lobos's movements in New York this week?. . MEDINA. Lobos landed at Teterboro airport on Tuesday. Once a year, he comes to New York to meet with his banker and his American attorneys. Now, he did make those meetings, but I followed him to a third, to meet this man Carlos ""Vibora"" Ruiz. Leader of the due loco set of the Soldado Nation Gang.. We learned that, one, Lobos has one single distributor for his product in New York City. Two, he's not entirely happy with his distributor. And three, soldado nation and Ruiz are too low-rent for Lobos.. They're not organized enough to distribute his product. And he was not shy in telling Mr. Ruiz he did not give a fuck!. . ANGELA. [Laughter] We have permission from the Mexican government to detain and prosecute Mr. Lobos if we can build a compelling case against him.. . FRANKIE. We can't touch him unless we know we can put him in jail.. . ANGELA. Who can give us the names, places, and dates we need to convict Lobos? His New York distributor. Unfortunately we have no idea who that is. We do have a profile of the type of criminal we're looking for. He's a highly organized individual with an established network in place. He already knows how to move money through the system, is violent enough to control his territory, but still has something to lose something Lobos can threaten to keep him in line. So why is Lobos looking to replace him? What could've gone wrong? There must be some element out of his control. [Pink Sneakers attempts to kill one of the carriers] Whatever the reason, this problem between Lobos and his local guy is exactly what we need to exploit, because the man we're looking for is in grave danger from Lobos and from us.. We can give him a way out, but only if he decides to take it.. . JAMES. [Cell phone vibrates] Tommy, what's up? I'm on my way.1Embed",ENTJ

The walls of my town, they come crumbling down. And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons. And I know their choices color all I’ve done. But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son. I never lived a year better spent in love. . [Hook]. 'Cause I know my weakness know my voice. And I believe in grace and choice. And I know perhaps my heart is farce. But I’ll be born without a mask. (Woo!). . [Verse 2]. Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride. I stretch my arms into the sky. I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now. Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down. You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl. As all we see will slip into the cloud. So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been. You know our breath is weak and our body thin. . [Bridge]. Press my nose up to the glass around your heart. I should’ve known I was weaker from the start.

If you got 20/20 vision. You can see Nina handling this music with precision. If not, then it's fine with me. Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see, Yates. . [Verse 1: Tech N9ne]. How in the hell can you miss me. When I'm counting my mil' making hist'ry. Trip the splits be that 50/50. So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly. When the trash, mail and pizza man see me. They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy. I'm easily beast and my hand is in my belt. What? I'm independent and I'm feeling myself. A flunk I won't be. I bumps the trunks see. The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey. They want to flaunt me. My songs be funky. Steady getting that cheddar forever. But some people acting like they don't see. [Chorus: B.o.B]. I'm top dog, something like a CEO. I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio. But they don't really see me though. But they don't really see me though. All night, life like a video. Prime time, something like a Super Bowl. But they don't really see me though. . [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]. With contact lenses say he don't smoke. I'm rolling up and let the contact get him. He even choked. My approach was to never to be broke. Kept my real niggas close. Now the player turned to coach. I hear people saying why so many changes?. Why so many watches? Why so many chains?. I'm mixing Kush with all these different strains. Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain. So much knowledge I came up on, you just a Hollywood insider. The inside of my crib look like a gym. Speaking of gym, I'm in the game, you're just a bench rider. You ride the bench that mean you ain't playing. You understand, hella fans. Bunch of hands, hundred grands that's the plan. Wizzle Man!. [Chorus: B.o.B]. I'm top dog, something like a CEO. I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio. But they don't really see me though. But they don't really see me though. All night, life like a video. Prime time, something like a Super Bowl. But they don't really see me though. . [Verse 3: Tech N9ne]. I'm truly blessed. I do request for all of you people to listen. I do see checks and movie sets. And never been a stranger to vixens. Pick up the pen, its in my gut to win. I got a motive and I’m in it with a mission. You know what I'mma get it when I dip into it. I've been through it, I've been a fighter with a vision. You can cover your eye, brother but why?. Cause your lady just discovered that my. Big rubber defies your lover blubber. So you utter replies with a tougher disguise. Cause my payday done caught the nose of your lady. I'm at the beginning of my hay-day. Y'all better Wrekonize like ¡Mayday!. I don't know why jokers just won't let their eyes notice.

865,865,Alessia Cara - here,"Here Lyrics[Written by Alessia Cara & Sebastian Kole]. [Produced by Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole]. . [Intro]. I guess right now you've got the last laugh. . [Verse 1]. I'm sorry if I seem uninterested. Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent. Truly I ain't got no business here. But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it. But really I would rather be at home all by myself. Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being. I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend. So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party. I'll be here, somewhere in the corner. Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'. I can hardly hear. Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you. So, tell my friends that I'll be over here. [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here. . [Verse 2]. Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this. An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this. And I know you mean only the best. And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be. Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to. Some music with a message, like we usually do. And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet. So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here. Not there in the kitchen. With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends. So, tell them I'll be here. Right next to the boy who's throwin' up. 'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more. Oh God, why am I here?. . [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here. [Bridge]. Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator. Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none. How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this. So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done. I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'. And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way. So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready. And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low. Yo, I'll be over here. . [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. And I can't wait till we can break up out of here405Embed",ENTJ

From these sliding, gliding, grinding ladies. That vaguely had me gaping like a spaceman looks at human faces. Then you got right, in the corner of my eyes. Getting rendered on my retina, printed, saved inside my memory card. With a rhythm for my heart, more than visibly off the charts. So heartfelt, that I dealt, all cards I held, smart. Though, really, guy like I, try to stay far from sacrificing. But that day I'd give my life to get a slice of those voluptuous thighs. Easily top five I'd ever eyed. With an effortless granted victory, only, mostly 'cause I. Got mesmerized, by your atlantic eyes. Who left me stranded like poetry when I dove inside. To read your constellations, looking for conversation. Mainly, maybe some fornication with your mind. [Chorus: David Ngyah]. She took the funk out of my soul. My rhythm is bluesin'.

Always knowing, I was destined to fail with you. [Chorus: David Ngyah]. She took the funk out of my soul. My rhythm is bluesin'. I see the moods, that you been swinging over me.

Will they hold the wall or will the city fall. . [Pre-Chorus 1]. Dedication. Dedication. They're outnumbered 15 to one. And the battle's begun. [Chorus]. Then the winged hussars arrived. Coming down the mountainside. Then the winged hussars arrived. Coming down they turned the tide. . [Verse 2]. As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high. No escape and no salvation. Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls. Plant the charges there and watch the city fear. . [Pre-Chorus 2]. Desperation. Desperation. It's a desperate race against the mine. And a race against time. . [Chorus]. Then the winged hussars arrived. Coming down the mountainside. Then the winged hussars arrived. Coming down they turned the tide. . [Bridge]. Cannonballs are coming down from the sky. Janissaries, are you ready to die?. We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye. You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate.

889,889,Nas - If I Ruled The World,"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That) Lyrics[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters]. . [Intro: Nas]. Life, I wonder. Will it take me under?. I don't know. [Verse 1: Nas]. Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing. Imagine going to court with no trial. Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters. More conscious of the way we raise our daughters. Days are shorter, nights are colder. Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra. The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently. It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually. Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge. If coke was cooked without the garbage. We'd all have the top dollars. Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes. Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles. Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers. Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers. Just some thoughts for the mind. I take a glimpse into time. Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine"". [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]. If I ruled the world (Imagine that). I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds and pearls. (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?). If I ruled the world. (Still living for today, in these last days and times). . [Verse 2: Nas]. The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'. Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon. Armani Exchange, the Range. Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last. Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path. The Villa house is for the crew, how we do. Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches. So many years of depression make me vision. The better living, type of place to raise kids in. Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul. But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child. Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling. Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding. Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage. Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish. Political prisoners set free, stress free. No work release, purple M3's and jet skis. Feel the wind breeze in West Indies. I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities. And reverse fiends to Willies. It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town. I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa. [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]. If I ruled the world (Imagine that). I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds and pearls. (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?). If I ruled the world. (Still living for today, in these last days and times). . [Bridge: Lauryn Hill]. And then we'll walk right up to the sun. Hand in hand. We'll walk right up to the sun. We won't land. We'll walk right up to the sun. Hand in hand. We'll walk right up to the sun. We won't land. . [Verse 3: Nas]. You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry. Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory. Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes. These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state. Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight. Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe. Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer. Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler. ‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich. Still, nobody want a nigga having shit. If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit. I push a Q-45 Infinit(i). It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony. Strictly living longevity to the destiny. I thought I'd never see, but reality struck. Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?. [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]. If I ruled the world (Imagine that). I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby. Black diamonds and pearls. (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?). If I ruled the world. (Still living for today, in these last days and times). If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that). I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled. I love 'em, love 'em baby. Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds. (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine). If I ruled the world. (Still living for today, in these last days and times). . [Outro: Lauryn Hill]. If I ruled the world, if I ruled. If I ruled, I'd free all my sons. Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby. Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled. If I ruled the world.

891,891,Arcade High - Cool Inc,"Slayer’s “Reign in Blood” (33 1/3 excerpt) Lyrics“Angel of Death”Reign in Blood opens with humanity’s worst-case-scenario (to date). “Angel of Death” is the kind of explicit reminder you won’t get from the Arcade Fire, Radiohead, or some emo singer who thinks life in modern America is a series of sad, overwhelming events. Slayer warn us: When authority goes wrong, your entire family can be slaughtered, their bones crushed to dust, and forgotten in mud.. . Hell Awaits took 90 long seconds to grab your throat and squeeze. Reign in Blood hits the road in fifth gear. From the first second, stereo blasts of percussive guitar and bass drive so hard it’s not clear the drums haven’t kicked in until Dave Lombardo’s cymbals ride in like the fourth horseman of the apocalypse.. . “You can’t top the beginning of ‘Angel of Death,” says Nuclear Assault’s Dan Lilker. “It’s like getting on the roller coaster.”. . Then Tom Araya delivers one of heavy metal’s great screams, and follows it with lyrics that -- coincidentally -- give it some context. The shriek doesn’t have the artful nuance of a Rob Halford hellion cry, but not many moments better embody heavy metal’s primal aggression.. . “It’s a perfect scream for that song,” says Beyond Fear singer Tim “Ripper” Owens. “For him, I don’t think it was much of a skill [move]. I think he’d be the first to admit it. I like his singing. He’s mastered it. Years ago, it was pretty heavy, but now, it’s really melodic too. He’s got a pretty cool tone.”. . “When the high-pitched scream comes in, it’s so badass,” says Municipal Waste frontman Tony Foresta. “When you’re driving your car, how many times have you almost wrecked your shit when that comes on?”. The lyrics that follow can make the moment’s effect change from awesome to ghastly: “Auschwitz, the meaning of pain / The way that I want you to die.” “Angel of Death” finds hell in our world.. . If the conventional notion of Hell does it exist, imagine the organizational infrastructure it would require. You’d need military-scale logistics to maintain an entire dimension of fire and brimstone, where condemned souls are punished for all eternity. Someone would have to assign sinners to their designated circles. If you don’t keep an eye on the flatterers, one of the shifty bastards is going to crawl out of the lake of human excrement and hide in a cave as soon as the demon on duty turns its head. If hell exists, you need physical and organizational infrastructures: fences, barbed wire, quarters, trenches, armed guards. Not to mention a clear shift schedule. And the place would stink of fire, excrement, and burning human flesh. If Hell is real, it’s probably a lot like Auschwitz.. . Reign in Blood starts with a narrative from what is one of the nadirs of human history: The Nazi Holocaust, the systematic murder of six million Catholics, communists, disabled people, Gypsies, homosexuals, socialists – and, far more than any other group, Jews. Poland’s Auschwitz was one of 20,000 Nazi death camps, a black hole of death where an estimated 1.1 million of the camp’s 1.3 million prisoners where killed – 960,000 of them Jewish. Josef Mengele was part of the greeting committee.. . A summary by United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mildly summarizes Mengele’s activities: “At Auschwitz… SS physicians carried out medical experiments. They conducted pseudoscientific research on infants, twins, and dwarfs, and performed forced sterilizations, castrations, and hypothermia experiments on adults. The best-known of these physicians was SS Captain Dr. Josef Mengele.”  Due to his extensive violations of the Hippocratic Oath -- in which physicians swear to do no harm -- history often deprives Mengele the title “doctor.” At Auschwitz, his nickname was “The Angel of Death.”. . Slayer’s “Angel of Death” wobbles from third-person (in which Hanneman condemns Mengele and his practices) to first-person narrative from the Nazi. Hanneman catalogs the terrors the Angel of Death inflicted: “Surgery with no anesthesia… Pumped with fluid inside your brain… Burning flesh drips away… Frigid cold cracks your limbs… Sewn together, joining heads… Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust… Rancid Angel of Death flying free.”. . With the Soviet army closing in, the Nazis fled Auschwitz in early 1945. As did many other Germans and Nazis, he fled to South America, where he hid until his drowning death in 1979.. . Graphic and disturbing, “Angel of Death” is controversial from every angle. The song caused a stir because Hanneman didn’t spend the entire five minutes condemning Mengele. (The guitarist wrote the lyrics and music, but the fact that guy singing “Destroying without mercy / To benefit the Aryan race” was named Araya didn’t help.). . Hanneman knew the subject matter was provocative, but he’s still incredulous when it’s taken as a pro-Nazi song.. . “Just read the lyrics,” says Hanneman. “But writing that, I wasn’t going to state the obvious. That’s like talking down to whoever’s reading it. I think they know he’s a bad guy. I don’t have to say, “Angel of Death / Bad guy.’ That would be stupid. I thought it was a great documentary.”. . For a generation whose parents who remembered World War II, Nazi imagery was an easy card to play when you wanted to be transgressive. Sid Vicious famously sported a swastika shirt. The Dead Boys paraded around in Third Reich uniforms. Black metal would eventually develop a right-wing Nazi sub-set that adored the song – much like Minor Threat’s “Guilty of Being White” – for all the wrong reasons. “Angel of Death” wasn’t unprecedented; it’s a narrative like Ramones’ “Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World,” but with more detail, and on a diabolical scale. And it names names.. . Rubin, born and raised Jewish, didn’t find the song anti-Semitic.. . “I did not find it offensive,” says Rubin.. . People who have read the lyrics and been to Auschwitz don’t think the song makes light of its sinister subject matter. Born after Vietnam ended, Unearth frontman Trevor Phipps thinks “Angel of Death” has educational value.. “That song was the one that hit me hardest,” says Phipps. “[Slayer have] always tried to tackle subjects that are heavy, whether it’s myth or it’s real. As a kid, I had no idea what [Hanneman via Araya]  was talking about. In 2002, touring Europe for the first time, we went to Auschwitz. That was a tougher experience than I thought it would be. It’s very eerie, just to combine the lyrics of that song with the gray feeling that you get when you’re there. And going back and reading the lyrics, it just kind of hit home for me.”. . The song isn’t just a eye-opener to wide-eyed 20-somethings. Helmet mainman Page Hamilton, 47, has studied history and Slayer. He’s seen Auschwitz.. . “I’ve never experienced a place that’s so spiritually and emotionally charged,” says Page Hamilton. “You can’t turn it into a news article or a History Channel documentary. You have to feel the souls that were lost there. It’s sort of beyond description. But the fact that they tried to convey that horror, I think they really get it across in the music. It’s a heavy thing to talk about. I think it’s a great album. It’s art.”. . “Angel of Death” is bleaker than the news – when was the last time you heard about Darfur on TV? And it’s more extreme than most heavy metal lyrics.. . “‘Angel of Death,’ the greatest death metal song every written,” says former Death drummer-songwriter Gene Hoglan. “Lyrically, no song can ever touch that song. It told a great story, and it’s terrifying. Nobody had anything as extreme and brutal as that.”. . For most Americans, the history lesson is an academic point. Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hütz grew up in the Ukraine and Eastern Europe, where death camps and Gulags are a fresh memory, and Auschwitz is still a word that pushes buttons. As the descendent of Romani Gypsies, he enjoyed the song more before he learned English.. . “It’s a totally ugly topic,” says Hütz. “Slayer writing about Auschwitz qualifies as a disturbing vehicle for a disturbing message. A lot of metal bands, there’s this comic-book horror, and their darkness is not real. Slayer doesn’t have that.”. . The song’s famous musical moments have overshadowed its controversy. Its speed, seminal musical moments, and conceptual content make it classic.. . After the second chorus, the drums and vocals drop away for a guitar breakdown that’s the opposite of a solo: Instead of putting the pedal to the metal, King and Hanneman slow down, sliding into a must-mosh-now guitar break that Mastodon’s Bill Kelliher calls a “devil disco.” Before a shadow guitar swoops in for a tandem groove, Lombardo fires a drum roll, turning what might have been a simple guitar trick into a 3-D rhythmic experience.. . “I play that two-second part over and over again,” says Henry Rollins. “It’s the perfect tease, like Lombardo’s stomping on your head. What a heavy groove they hit on that. That’s my favorite moment on that record. And I love the minutiae on records, those moments where I’m like, ‘Oh, man.’ James Brown’s got ‘em. Led Zeppelin’s got ‘em. And Slayer’s got a few.”. . The song ends with multiple climaxes. King and Hanneman trade off incendiary solos like they’re firing uzis at each other. When they can’t possibly push it any further, everything else falls away, and Lombardo takes the spotlight, feet pumping like a jackhammer, for the most influential moment in metal drumming. In that three-second break, the first two-thirds is all double-bass, and Lombardo connects 28 times in a mere two seconds.. . “What Slayer did, including that double-bass break on ‘Angel of Death,’ they did shit that no one else did, because they could,” says former Overkill drummer Rat Skates. “And you listen to that part, and you just knew: Those are two bass drums. That guy’s feet are fuckin’ flying.’ It blew everyone’s mind.”. . It still does.. “That specific part, it broke the speed barrier,” says Mastodon drummer Brann Dailor. “It would make me happy when I heard it. Everybody at a Slayer show would wait to hear it. And everything else paled in comparison -- until grindcore happened. But grindcore, I think it loses something.”. . Lombardo didn’t invent double-bass kicks. In 1986, drummers like Skates, Hoglan, and Anthrax’s Charlie Benante were all doing their share to refine the technique. But with that three-second solo, the innovation became a convention, and Lombardo would get principle credit. As Slayer fill-in drummer Anthony “T.J.” Scaglione would learn the on the Reign tour, at the time, only two drummers had that combination of speed and strength: Hoglan and Lombardo.. . “It’s not difficult drumming patterns, per se,” says Scaglione.  “I think the key to it is the stamina aspect of it. Slayer was pretty much the fastest thing going at that point. You can play a drum pattern or any  rhythmic pattern slow. But to speed it up and play it accurately is a challenge.”. . Today, songs like Behemoth’s “Slaying The Prophets Ov Isa” feature a song-long double-bass barrage.. . “It’s gotten to the point where it is more of an athletic-aerobic institution than it is a musical expression,” says Hoglan, who helped Lombardo figure out the intricacies of the double-bass kit. “Back in the day, you were just throwing in your double bass when the beat flipped over, or when you really want to kick it up a notch to really slam your point home. But now, it’s definitely used as ‘Hey look at me – look at what I can do for five minutes!’ It’s kind of robotic now.”. . The kicks that launched a million kicks were a holdover from the Hell Awaits tour. The future of metal drumming was born in the most agonizingly dull convention of arena-rock excess: Slayer’s 1985 tour was the band’s last trek with an extended solo. Lombardo would pepper his four-minute spazz-outs with double-bass bursts. The roll caught King’s ear, and the guitarist decided it would work in a song. Subsequent generations haven’t forgotten Lombardo.. . “His double bass is amazing, super spot-on,” says Larry Herweg, drummer of Pelican. “His legs are like a machine. The Lombardo double bass drum fill in that song is classic. He is the king of super long drum fills.”. . The band’s signature song, “Angel of Death” has been their show closer since 1988’s South of Heaven tour. (With two notable exceptions: In fall 2003, they played the entire Reign album; and in fall 2004, they closed with “Angel,” “Postmortem,” “Raining Blood,” and a blood rain dubbed “The Wall of Blood.”) Like a smoldering Hendrix guitar, it’s the kind of performance no one wants to follow. King’s take on it is typically understated: “It ends my set and signals it’s party time.”4Embed",ENTP

And what did the doctor order today?. . —Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.. . Jingle.. . —With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.. . With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself.

Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.. . Yes, bronze from anearby.. . —... Sweetheart, goodbye!. . —I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.. . He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.. . —Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.. . Tom Rochford.... . —Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.. . Lenehan gulped to go.. . —Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.. . He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.. . —How do you do, Mr Dollard?. . —Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.. . Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.. . —Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.. . Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.. . —What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.. . —Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.. . He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.. . Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.. . Jingle a tinkle jaunted.. . Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.. . —Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.. . Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.. . —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.. . There was.. . —A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.. . —God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.. . They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.. . —Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?. . He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.. . —I saved the situation, Ben, I think.. . —You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.. . Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.. . —I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.. . —By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.. . Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.. . —Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?. . —Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.. . Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.. . Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.. . Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.. . —What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion.... . —Tweedy.. . —Yes. Is she alive?. . —And kicking.. . —She was a daughter of.... . —Daughter of the regiment.. . —Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.. . Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after. . —Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?. . Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.. . —Buccinator muscle is... What?...

As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.. . Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.. . By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.

Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.. . —War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.. . —So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.. . He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.. . —Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.. . In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.. . —Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.. . Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.. . —............ my ardent soul. I care not foror the morrow.. . In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.. . Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.. . —Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.. . George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.. . Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.. . Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.. . Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.. . Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.. . —Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.. . Strongly.. . —Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.. . —M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.. . Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.. . Cowley sang:. . —M'appari tutt'amor:. Il mio sguardo l'incontr.... . She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.. . —Go on, Simon.. . —Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well.... . Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.. . —No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.. . The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.. . Up stage strode Father Cowley.. . —Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.. . By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.. . Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.. . Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.. . Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.. . Speech paused on Richie's lips.. . Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.. . Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.. . —Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.. . —All is lost now.. . Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.. . Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.. . —A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.. . Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.. . He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?. . Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.. . Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.. . Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.. . —With it, Simon.. . —It, Simon.. . —Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.. . —It, Simon.. . —I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.. . By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.. . The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.. . —When first I saw that form endearing.... . Richie turned.. . —Si Dedalus' voice, he said.. . Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.. . —Sorrow from me seemed to depart.. . Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.. . Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.. . —Full of hope and all delighted.... . Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.. . Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.. . —But alas, 'twas idle dreaming.... . Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.. . Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.. . Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.. . Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.. . Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup.

Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.. . The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.. . Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.. . —Each graceful look.... . First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.. . Round and round slow. Quick round. We two.

Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.. . —Martha! Ah, Martha!. . Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.. . —Co-ome, thou lost one!. Co-ome, thou dear one!. . Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!. . —Come!. . It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness.... . —To me!. .

An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.. . And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.. . —Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.. . Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.. . Admiring.. . Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang 'Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.. . Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang 'Twas rank and fame.. . He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.. . Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.. . That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.. . Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.. . Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems.

Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.. . —Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.. . —It is, Bloom said.. . Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.. . Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning.

Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.. . A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.. . But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that?

So what, so what, so what's the scenario?. . [Verse 1: Phife Dawg & All]. A-yo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?). But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap. Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat. No batteries included, and no strings attached. No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'. Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon. Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow. But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so. Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop. But here's the real scoop. I'm all that and then some; short, dark, and handsome. Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from. I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here. My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there. (Yeah!) Head for the border, go get a taco. Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go. Sit back, relax, and let yourself go. Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know. [Verse 2: Charlie Brown & All]. Yes, yes, y'all! (Yes, y'all!). Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all! (Tribe, y'all!). Real live, y'all! (Live, y'all!). Inside, outside, come arooound. (Who's that?) Brooooown!. So, may I say, call me Charlie. The word is the herb, and I'm deep like Bob Marley. Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates (Contact!). Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip. With a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip. East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'. New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton. Checka-checka-check it out!. The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce. And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?. We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex, next!. It's the textbook, old to the new, but the rest are doo-doo. From radio, to the video, to Arsenio. Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?. . [Verse 3: Dinco D & All]. (True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo. Scenarios, radios, rates more than four. Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors. Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore. Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes. Papes make drakes baked for the wakes. Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader. Base in the space means peace, see ya later. Later (Later!) Later, alligator. Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her. So, yo, the D, what! The O. Incorporated I-N-C into a flow. Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh. Yo, how'd that sound? (Ooooh!). [Verse 4: Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, & All]. It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!). Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!). I could give a damn about a ill subliminal. Stay away from crime, so I ain't no (criminal!). I love my young nation, groovy sensation. No time for hibernation, only elation. Don't ever try to test the water, little kid. Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did—. —I heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!). Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!). Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere. Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—. —You know I did it. So don't violate or you'll get violated. The hip-hop sound is well agitated. Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego. So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:. . [Verse 5: Busta Rhymes & All]. Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind. Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind. Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!. Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine. Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary, when diggin' into my library. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!. Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh. Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man. Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!. As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon. When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron. Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon. Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'. Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban. And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine. Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken. The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'. Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme. The rhythm is in sync (Unh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!). Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio. Observe the vibe and check out the scenario.

I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did. With every broken bone I swear I lived. [Verse 2]. Hope that you spend your days but they all add up. And when that sun goes down hope you raise your cup. I wish that I could witness all your joy and all your pain. But until my moment comes, I'll say:. . [Chorus]. I, I did it all. I, I did it all. I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did. With every broken bone I swear I lived. . [Bridge]. (With every broken bone) I swear I lived. (With every broken bone) I swear I. . [Chorus]. I, I did it all. I, I did it all. I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did.

898,898,Ye - Devil in a New Dress,"Devil In a New Dress Lyrics[Produced by Bink! and Mike Dean]. . [Intro: Kanye West]. Uh. Uh. I love it, though. I love it, though, huh, you know?. [Chorus: Kanye West]. Uh, put your hands to the constellations. The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation. I know I'm preachin' to the congregation. We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan. I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting. We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation. [Verse 1: Kanye West]. May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us. In that magic hour, I seen good Christians. Make brash decisions, oh, she do it. What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it. She putting on her makeup, she casually allure. Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour. How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?. I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off. Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme. Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron. I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?"". Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime. [Chorus: Kanye West]. Put your hands to the constellations. The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation. I know I'm preachin' to the congregation. We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan. Satan, Satan, Satan. I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting. We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation. . [Verse 2: Kanye West]. When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour. And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies. You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes. Why you standing there with your face screwed up?. Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up. Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up. Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us. I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat. I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat. You see, I always loved that sense of humor. But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was. The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme. That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie"". The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?. You love me for me, could you be more phony?. Related SongsRunawayKanye WestSo AppalledKanye WestMercyKanye West[Chorus: Kanye West]. Put your hands to the constellations. The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation. Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening. Cat got your tongue?. [Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]. [Verse 3: Rick Ross]. Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone. Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone. Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone. Double-headed monster with a mind of his own. Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character. All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender. I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders. Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh). Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder. We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh. Hater talkin' never made me mad. Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag. Therefore, G4s at the Clearport. When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy. When it came to dope, I was quick to export. Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport. New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport. So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud. Different traps I was gettin' mail from. Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne. Whole clique appetites had tapeworms. Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns. I shed a tear before the night's over. God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh). Getting 2Pac money twice over. Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller. I'm makin' love to the angel of death. Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh). Uh216Embed",ENTP
899,899,Sidney Gish - Homecoming Serf,"Homecoming Serf LyricsSixty-five miles an hour. I'm not home yet. Telephone poles get. Blurred together, in gray weather. Till they look like crucifixes. Until something in me thinks if. I was nimble enough,. I'd climb one up and be a symbol. Giving cars a heart attack. I've got a knack for these shock tactics. And I want my suburb back. But it was never mine,. Besides, I'd never crucify. Myself, and Jesus of Suburbia's. A myth that never died. Homecoming queen, not in my dreams. I'll be homecoming serf, it seems. But hey, it doesn’t even bother me. We've moved away, and who needs royalty?. I love vacation days. It's a blacked-out​ haze I’m in. This cul-de-sac is coming. Back, back, back, back, back. . Who cares if we're obscure?. Homecoming serf. I know this quiet life, it used to hurt. But now we're dancing 'round and laughing in the dirt. . It's barely one PM. And my cooking's barely done. And my thighs feel like the chicken breast I hated slicing up. I think I'll be a vegetarian, kill two birds with one stone. I'll lose a stone, I'll feel humane. I cook the meat and eat it anyway. I think that I'll rebel now. Not like my age is too late. I'm still half straight but I can easily. Act gayer than FCK H8. . And I'll tell kids to smoke cigs and weed. Despite the surgeon's warning. I'll eat LSD soaked Mini-Wheats. In White Russians for breakfast every morning. . I love vacation days. It's a blacked-out haze I'm in. This cul-de-sac is coming. Back, back, back, back, back. . Who cares if we're obscure?. Homecoming serf. I know this quiet life, it used to hurt. But now we're dancing 'round and laughing in the dirt. . La la la la la la la la. . Don't think I'm pointing fingers. These are crocodile tears. It's no one's fault but mine. That I shut up. For all of eighteen years. But now my friends are driving out. We're gonna walk around the mall. And we'll be the youngest there. Who cares, we'll call ourselves adults. . At least I've got a cat,. Though she hates me bad, it seems. But we reign over the SUVs and Dairy Queens. This isn't lyricism. I'm just dropping rhymes like flies. Let’s go freak out everyone. No reason, who knows why?. . What's on your mind?. Not like I've got the time to stick around,. I'll catch my flight,. Make like a pop punk kid, and get out of this town. What's on your mind?. There's no point left to keep your image down,. Let's terrify. . I love vacation days. It's a blacked-out haze I'm in. This cul-de-sac is coming. Back, back, back, back, back. . Who cares if we're obscure?. Homecoming serf. I know this quiet life, it used to hurt. But now we're dancing 'round and laughing in the dirt. . This one goes out to my homecoming serfs. Yeah, pour one out for my homecoming serfs. This one goes out to my homecoming serfs. We're dancing 'round and laughing in the dirtEmbed",ENTP

We're changing our ways, taking different roads. . [Chorus]. Love will tear us apart again. Love will tear us apart again. . [Verse 2]. Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side. Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry. Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives. [Chorus]. Love will tear us apart again. Love will tear us apart again. . [Verse 3]. You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed. And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold. Just that something so good just can't function no more. . [Chorus].

905,905,Brockhampton - I Been Born Again,"I BEEN BORN AGAIN Lyrics[Intro: bearface]. Out on the deck like I'm wildin' for respect. It's a three-peat, see-see. Bitch, you in the D-League. Boy, you fucked up. Can't come around here, this shit is gated. We made it, happy belated, I see the rage hit. . [Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]. It's better if I try not to talk about the shit that's always on my mind. Money on my mind (That's right), couple hunnids at a time. Try to fuck me blind, duckin' down, hear me whine (Ooh). We outside now (That's right), milk carton in the back. We don't like to fuck around with them niggas in the back. Pullin' triggers in the 'Lac (That's right). May the praise stay bad. Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right). Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress. Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards. Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit. Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still. Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still. Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here. God gave me a good deal. Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel. Bitch, I wanna hit still. This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them. Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman (That's right). [Verse 2:  Merlyn Wood]. Like I'm Dennis Rodman. Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem (That's right). Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend. Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem (That's right). She so bad, I let her touch my butt (Yeah). Merlyn, what the fuck?. . [Verse 3: Dom McLennon]. Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' (That's right). It ain't no one business who or what we doin’ (That's right). Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin’. To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance. . [Verse 4: Joba]. Sugar, yeah, gimme some. Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some. Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'. Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?. This what it mean to ball?. Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La. Valet park it, drive a shit whip. But I ain't broke, bitch. Write my own shit, hit my own switch. Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid. Tell it like it is. Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead. Texas 'til I'm dead. BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed. Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain. Screwed up from The Woodlands. Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent. Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know. Guess I found him, I am blessed, man. Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats. I ain't trippin', but copy that. It's a wrap, keep my distance. Where's Waldo, but we winnin'. Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right). The real know, what's a billfold?. You can't fold, I stay grinnin'. No peekin'. [Bridge: Henock Sileshi]. Go ahead and try harder. You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody. You oughta be ashamed of yourselves. Get on your damn knees. And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass. You oughta be ashamed of yourselves. Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there. That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker. You oughta be ashamed of yourselves. . [Outro: Matt Champion]. S-s-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. Send 'em-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. Send 'em-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. They ain't knockin' no more. They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more. S-s-s-s-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. Send 'em-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. Send 'em-send 'em out the door. They ain't knockin' no more. They-they-they ain't knockin' no more.

910,910,INZO - Overthinker,"Overthinker Lyrics[Spoken Word: Alan Watts]. A person who thinks all the time. Has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull. Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating. I'm not saying that thinking is bad. Like everything else, it's useful in moderation. A good servant, but a bad master. And all so-called civilized peoples. Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive. Because through excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality. That's to say. We confuse signs. With the real world. [Drop]. This is the beginning of meditation. . Most of us would have rather money than tangible wealth. And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed. And to read about it the next day in the newspaper. Is oddly more fun for us than the original event. This is a disaster. For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs. We are destroying nature. We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses. Time to wake up. What is reality?. Obviously, no one can say. Because it isn't words. It isn't material, that's just an idea. Reality is-. . [Drop]. The point cannot be explained in words. . I'm not trying to put you down. It's an expression of you as you are. One must live.... We need to survive, to go on. We must go on19Embed",ENTP

beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was’nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was

916,916,Grant Green - Idle Moments,"The Awakening: Chapters 15-19 LyricsXV. . When Edna entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her habit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on. Several persons were talking at once, and Victor's voice was predominating, even over that of his mother. Edna had returned late from her bath, had dressed in some haste, and her face was flushed. Her head, set off by her dainty white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom. She took her seat at table between old Monsieur Farival and Madame Ratignolle.. As she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup, which had been served when she entered the room, several persons informed her simultaneously that Robert was going to Mexico. She laid her spoon down and looked about her bewildered. He had been with her, reading to her all the morning, and had never even mentioned such a place as Mexico. She had not seen him during the afternoon; she had heard some one say he was at the house, upstairs with his mother. This she had thought nothing of, though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the afternoon, when she went down to the beach.. She looked across at him, where he sat beside Madame Lebrun, who presided. Edna's face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she never thought of disguising. He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy. ""When is he going?"" she asked of everybody in general, as if Robert were not there to answer for himself.. ""To-night!"" ""This very evening!"" ""Did you ever!"" ""What possesses him!"" were some of the replies she gathered, uttered simultaneously in French and English.. ""Impossible!"" she exclaimed. ""How can a person start off from Grand Isle to Mexico at a moment's notice, as if he were going over to Klein's or to the wharf or down to the beach?"". ""I said all along I was going to Mexico; I've been saying so for years!"" cried Robert, in an excited and irritable tone, with the air of a man defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects.. Madame Lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle.. ""Please let Robert explain why he is going, and why he is going to-night,"" she called out. ""Really, this table is getting to be more and more like Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once. Sometimes—I hope God will forgive me—but positively, sometimes I wish Victor would lose the power of speech."". Victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish, of which he failed to see the benefit to anybody, except that it might afford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself.. Monsieur Farival thought that Victor should have been taken out in mid-ocean in his earliest youth and drowned. Victor thought there would be more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim for making themselves universally obnoxious. Madame Lebrun grew a trifle hysterical; Robert called his brother some sharp, hard names.. ""There's nothing much to explain, mother,"" he said; though he explained, nevertheless—looking chiefly at Edna—that he could only meet the gentleman whom he intended to join at Vera Cruz by taking such and such a steamer, which left New Orleans on such a day; that Beaudelet was going out with his lugger-load of vegetables that night, which gave him an opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time.. ""But when did you make up your mind to all this?"" demanded Monsieur Farival.. ""This afternoon,"" returned Robert, with a shade of annoyance.. ""At what time this afternoon?"" persisted the old gentleman, with nagging determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of justice.. ""At four o'clock this afternoon, Monsieur Farival,"" Robert replied, in a high voice and with a lofty air, which reminded Edna of some gentleman on the stage.. She had forced herself to eat most of her soup, and now she was picking the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork.. The lovers were profiting by the general conversation on Mexico to speak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to no one but themselves. The lady in black had once received a pair of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico, with very special indulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border. Father Fochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; but he had not done so to her satisfaction. And she begged that Robert would interest himself, and discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads.. Madame Ratignolle hoped that Robert would exercise extreme caution in dealing with the Mexicans, who, she considered, were a treacherous people, unscrupulous and revengeful. She trusted she did them no injustice in thus condemning them as a race. She had known personally but one Mexican, who made and sold excellent tamales, and whom she would have trusted implicitly, so soft-spoken was he. One day he was arrested for stabbing his wife. She never knew whether he had been hanged or not.. Victor had grown hilarious, and was attempting to tell an anecdote about a Mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in Dauphine Street. No one would listen to him but old Monsieur Farival, who went into convulsions over the droll story.. Edna wondered if they had all gone mad, to be talking and clamoring at that rate. She herself could think of nothing to say about Mexico or the Mexicans.. ""At what time do you leave?"" she asked Robert.. ""At ten,"" he told her. ""Beaudelet wants to wait for the moon."". ""Are you all ready to go?"". ""Quite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the city."". He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna, having finished her black coffee, left the table.. She went directly to her room. The little cottage was close and stuffy after leaving the outer air. But she did not mind; there appeared to be a hundred different things demanding her attention indoors. She began to set the toilet-stand to rights, grumbling at the negligence of the quadroon, who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed. She gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of chairs, and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer. She changed her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper. She rearranged her hair, combing and brushing it with unusual energy. Then she went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed.. They were very playful and inclined to talk—to do anything but lie quiet and go to sleep. Edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and told her she need not return. Then she sat and told the children a story. Instead of soothing it excited them, and added to their wakefulness. She left them in heated argument, speculating about the conclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the following night.. The little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to have Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr. Robert went away. Edna returned answer that she had already undressed, that she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the house later. She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to remove her peignoir. But changing her mind once more she resumed the peignoir, and went outside and sat down before her door. She was overheated and irritable, and fanned herself energetically for a while. Madame Ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter.. ""All that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me,"" replied Edna, ""and moreover, I hate shocks and surprises. The idea of Robert starting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way! As if it were a matter of life and death! Never saying a word about it all morning when he was with me."". ""Yes,"" agreed Madame Ratignolle. ""I think it was showing us all—you especially—very little consideration. It wouldn't have surprised me in any of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics. But I must say I should never have expected such a thing from Robert. Are you not coming down? Come on, dear; it doesn't look friendly."". ""No,"" said Edna, a little sullenly. ""I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it."". ""You needn't dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist. Just look at me!"". ""No,"" persisted Edna; ""but you go on. Madame Lebrun might be offended if we both stayed away."". Madame Ratignolle kissed Edna good-night, and went away, being in truth rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation which was still in progress concerning Mexico and the Mexicans.. Somewhat later Robert came up, carrying his hand-bag.. ""Aren't you feeling well?"" he asked.. ""Oh, well enough. Are you going right away?"". He lit a match and looked at his watch. ""In twenty minutes,"" he said. The sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while. He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch.. ""Get a chair,"" said Edna.. ""This will do,"" he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the heat.. ""Take the fan,"" said Edna, offering it to him.. ""Oh, no! Thank you. It does no good; you have to stop fanning some time, and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward."". ""That's one of the ridiculous things which men always say. I have never known one to speak otherwise of fanning. How long will you be gone?"". ""Forever, perhaps. I don't know. It depends upon a good many things."". ""Well, in case it shouldn't be forever, how long will it be?"". ""I don't know."". ""This seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for. I don't like it. I don't understand your motive for silence and mystery, never saying a word to me about it this morning."" He remained silent, not offering to defend himself. He only said, after a moment:. ""Don't part from me in any ill humor. I never knew you to be out of patience with me before."". ""I don't want to part in any ill humor,"" she said. ""But can't you understand? I've grown used to seeing you, to having you with me all the time, and your action seems unfriendly, even unkind. You don't even offer an excuse for it. Why, I was planning to be together, thinking of how pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter."". ""So was I,"" he blurted. ""Perhaps that's the—"" He stood up suddenly and held out his hand. ""Good-by, my dear Mrs. Pontellier; good-by. You won't—I hope you won't completely forget me."" She clung to his hand, striving to detain him.. ""Write to me when you get there, won't you, Robert?"" she entreated.. ""I will, thank you. Good-by."". How unlike Robert! The merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than ""I will, thank you; good-by,"" to such a request.. He had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house, for he descended the steps and went to join Beaudelet, who was out there with an oar across his shoulder waiting for Robert. They walked away in the darkness. She could only hear Beaudelet's voice; Robert had apparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion.. Edna bit her handkerchief convulsively, striving to hold back and to hide, even from herself as she would have hidden from another, the emotion which was troubling—tearing—her. Her eyes were brimming with tears.. For the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she had felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and later as a young woman. The recognition did not lessen the reality, the poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability. The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to heed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate. The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being demanded.. . . . XVI. . ""Do you miss your friend greatly?"" asked Mademoiselle Reisz one morning as she came creeping up behind Edna, who had just left her cottage on her way to the beach. She spent much of her time in the water since she had acquired finally the art of swimming. As their stay at Grand Isle drew near its close, she felt that she could not give too much time to a diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she knew. When Mademoiselle Reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and spoke to her, the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in Edna's mind; or, better, the feeling which constantly possessed her.. Robert's going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning out of everything. The conditions of her life were in no way changed, but her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing. She sought him everywhere—in others whom she induced to talk about him. She went up in the mornings to Madame Lebrun's room, braving the clatter of the old sewing-machine. She sat there and chatted at intervals as Robert had done. She gazed around the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall, and discovered in some corner an old family album, which she examined with the keenest interest, appealing to Madame Lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its pages.. There was a picture of Madame Lebrun with Robert as a baby, seated in her lap, a round-faced infant with a fist in his mouth. The eyes alone in the baby suggested the man. And that was he also in kilts, at the age of five, wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand. It made Edna laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers; while another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions. But there was no recent picture, none which suggested the Robert who had gone away five days ago, leaving a void and wilderness behind him.. ""Oh, Robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for them himself! He found wiser use for his money, he says,"" explained Madame Lebrun. She had a letter from him, written before he left New Orleans. Edna wished to see the letter, and Madame Lebrun told her to look for it either on the table or the dresser, or perhaps it was on the mantelpiece.. The letter was on the bookshelf. It possessed the greatest interest and attraction for Edna; the envelope, its size and shape, the post-mark, the handwriting. She examined every detail of the outside before opening it. There were only a few lines, setting forth that he would leave the city that afternoon, that he had packed his trunk in good shape, that he was well, and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately remembered to all. There was no special message to Edna except a postscript saying that if Mrs. Pontellier desired to finish the book which he had been reading to her, his mother would find it in his room, among other books there on the table. Edna experienced a pang of jealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her.. Every one seemed to take for granted that she missed him. Even her husband, when he came down the Saturday following Robert's departure, expressed regret that he had gone.. ""How do you get on without him, Edna?"" he asked.. ""It's very dull without him,"" she admitted. Mr. Pontellier had seen Robert in the city, and Edna asked him a dozen questions or more. Where had they met? On Carondelet Street, in the morning. They had gone ""in"" and had a drink and a cigar together. What had they talked about? Chiefly about his prospects in Mexico, which Mr. Pontellier thought were promising. How did he look? How did he seem—grave, or gay, or how? Quite cheerful, and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip, which Mr. Pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek fortune and adventure in a strange, queer country.. Edna tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children persisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive.. It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of Robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him. The sentiment which she entertained for Robert in no way resembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever expected to feel. She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves. They had never taken the form of struggles. They belonged to her and were her own, and she entertained the conviction that she had a right to them and that they concerned no one but herself. Edna had once told Madame Ratignolle that she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one. Then had followed a rather heated argument; the two women did not appear to understand each other or to be talking the same language. Edna tried to appease her friend, to explain.. ""I would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my life for my children; but I wouldn't give myself. I can't make it more clear; it's only something which I am beginning to comprehend, which is revealing itself to me."". ""I don't know what you would call the essential, or what you mean by the unessential,"" said Madame Ratignolle, cheerfully; ""but a woman who would give her life for her children could do no more than that—your Bible tells you so. I'm sure I couldn't do more than that."". ""Oh, yes you could!"" laughed Edna.. She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz's question the morning that lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend.. ""Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss Robert. Are you going down to bathe?"". ""Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven't been in the surf all summer,"" replied the woman, disagreeably.. ""I beg your pardon,"" offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz's avoidance of the water had furnished a theme for much pleasantry. Some among them thought it was on account of her false hair, or the dread of getting the violets wet, while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament. Mademoiselle offered Edna some chocolates in a paper bag, which she took from her pocket, by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling. She habitually ate chocolates for their sustaining quality; they contained much nutriment in small compass, she said. They saved her from starvation, as Madame Lebrun's table was utterly impossible; and no one save so impertinent a woman as Madame Lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it.. ""She must feel very lonely without her son,"" said Edna, desiring to change the subject. ""Her favorite son, too. It must have been quite hard to let him go."". Mademoiselle laughed maliciously.. ""Her favorite son! Oh, dear! Who could have been imposing such a tale upon you? Aline Lebrun lives for Victor, and for Victor alone. She has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the ground he walks on. Robert is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself. Favorite son, indeed! I miss the poor fellow myself, my dear. I liked to see him and to hear him about the place the only Lebrun who is worth a pinch of salt. He comes to see me often in the city. I like to play to him. That Victor! hanging would be too good for him. It's a wonder Robert hasn't beaten him to death long ago."". ""I thought he had great patience with his brother,"" offered Edna, glad to be talking about Robert, no matter what was said.. ""Oh! he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago,"" said Mademoiselle. ""It was about a Spanish girl, whom Victor considered that he had some sort of claim upon. He met Robert one day talking to the girl, or walking with her, or bathing with her, or carrying her basket—I don't remember what;—and he became so insulting and abusive that Robert gave him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good while. It's about time he was getting another."". ""Was her name Mariequita?"" asked Edna.. ""Mariequita—yes, that was it; Mariequita. I had forgotten. Oh, she's a sly one, and a bad one, that Mariequita!"". Edna looked down at Mademoiselle Reisz and wondered how she could have listened to her venom so long. For some reason she felt depressed, almost unhappy. She had not intended to go into the water; but she donned her bathing suit, and left Mademoiselle alone, seated under the shade of the children's tent. The water was growing cooler as the season advanced. Edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and invigorated her. She remained a long time in the water, half hoping that Mademoiselle Reisz would not wait for her.. But Mademoiselle waited. She was very amiable during the walk back, and raved much over Edna's appearance in her bathing suit. She talked about music. She hoped that Edna would go to see her in the city, and wrote her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in her pocket.. ""When do you leave?"" asked Edna.. ""Next Monday; and you?"". ""The following week,"" answered Edna, adding, ""It has been a pleasant summer, hasn't it, Mademoiselle?"". ""Well,"" agreed Mademoiselle Reisz, with a shrug, ""rather pleasant, if it hadn't been for the mosquitoes and the Farival twins."". . . . XVII. . The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New Orleans. It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted columns supported the sloping roof. The house was painted a dazzling white; the outside shutters, or jalousies, were green. In the yard, which was kept scrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes in South Louisiana. Within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type. The softest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies hung at doors and windows. There were paintings, selected with judgment and discrimination, upon the walls. The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands were less generous than Mr. Pontellier.. Mr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its various appointments and details, to see that nothing was amiss. He greatly valued his possessions, chiefly because they were his, and derived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting, a statuette, a rare lace curtain—no matter what—after he had bought it and placed it among his household gods.. On Tuesday afternoons—Tuesday being Mrs. Pontellier's reception day—there was a constant stream of callers—women who came in carriages or in the street cars, or walked when the air was soft and distance permitted. A light-colored mulatto boy, in dress coat and bearing a diminutive silver tray for the reception of cards, admitted them. A maid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or chocolate, as they might desire. Mrs. Pontellier, attired in a handsome reception gown, remained in the drawing-room the entire afternoon receiving her visitors. Men sometimes called in the evening with their wives.. This had been the programme which Mrs. Pontellier had religiously followed since her marriage, six years before. Certain evenings during the week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play.. Mr. Pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o'clock, and rarely returned before half-past six or seven in the evening—dinner being served at half-past seven.. He and his wife seated themselves at table one Tuesday evening, a few weeks after their return from Grand Isle. They were alone together. The boys were being put to bed; the patter of their bare, escaping feet could be heard occasionally, as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon, lifted in mild protest and entreaty. Mrs. Pontellier did not wear her usual Tuesday reception gown; she was in ordinary house dress. Mr. Pontellier, who was observant about such things, noticed it, as he served the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting.. ""Tired out, Edna? Whom did you have? Many callers?"" he asked. He tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar, mustard—everything within reach.. ""There were a good many,"" replied Edna, who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction. ""I found their cards when I got home; I was out."". ""Out!"" exclaimed her husband, with something like genuine consternation in his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his glasses. ""Why, what could have taken you out on Tuesday? What did you have to do?"". ""Nothing. I simply felt like going out, and I went out."". ""Well, I hope you left some suitable excuse,"" said her husband, somewhat appeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup.. ""No, I left no excuse. I told Joe to say I was out, that was all."". ""Why, my dear, I should think you'd understand by this time that people don't do such things; we've got to observe les convenances if we ever expect to get on and keep up with the procession. If you felt that you had to leave home this afternoon, you should have left some suitable explanation for your absence.. ""This soup is really impossible; it's strange that woman hasn't learned yet to make a decent soup. Any free-lunch stand in town serves a better one. Was Mrs. Belthrop here?"". ""Bring the tray with the cards, Joe. I don't remember who was here."". The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver tray, which was covered with ladies' visiting cards. He handed it to Mrs. Pontellier.. ""Give it to Mr. Pontellier,"" she said.. Joe offered the tray to Mr. Pontellier, and removed the soup.. Mr. Pontellier scanned the names of his wife's callers, reading some of them aloud, with comments as he read.. ""'The Misses Delasidas.' I worked a big deal in futures for their father this morning; nice girls; it's time they were getting married. 'Mrs. Belthrop.' I tell you what it is, Edna; you can't afford to snub Mrs. Belthrop. Why, Belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over. His business is worth a good, round sum to me. You'd better write her a note. 'Mrs. James Highcamp.' Hugh! the less you have to do with Mrs. Highcamp, the better. 'Madame Laforce.' Came all the way from Carrolton, too, poor old soul. 'Miss Wiggs,' 'Mrs. Eleanor Boltons.'"" He pushed the cards aside.. ""Mercy!"" exclaimed Edna, who had been fuming. ""Why are you taking the thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it?"". ""I'm not making any fuss over it. But it's just such seeming trifles that we've got to take seriously; such things count."". The fish was scorched. Mr. Pontellier would not touch it. Edna said she did not mind a little scorched taste. The roast was in some way not to his fancy, and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served.. ""It seems to me,"" he said, ""we spend money enough in this house to procure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his self-respect."". ""You used to think the cook was a treasure,"" returned Edna, indifferently.. ""Perhaps she was when she first came; but cooks are only human. They need looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ. Suppose I didn't look after the clerks in my office, just let them run things their own way; they'd soon make a nice mess of me and my business."". ""Where are you going?"" asked Edna, seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highly-seasoned soup.. ""I'm going to get my dinner at the club. Good night."" He went into the hall, took his hat and stick from the stand, and left the house.. She was somewhat familiar with such scenes. They had often made her very unhappy. On a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner. Sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook. Once she went to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening, finally writing out a menu for the week, which left her harassed with a feeling that, after all, she had accomplished no good that was worth the name.. But that evening Edna finished her dinner alone, with forced deliberation. Her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that lighted them. After finishing her dinner she went to her room, having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed.. It was a large, beautiful room, rich and picturesque in the soft, dim light which the maid had turned low. She went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage. She was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet, half-darkness which met her moods. But the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars. They jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise, devoid even of hope. She turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping, without resting. She carried in her hands a thin handkerchief, which she tore into ribbons, rolled into a ball, and flung from her. Once she stopped, and taking off her wedding ring, flung it upon the carpet. When she saw it lying there, she stamped her heel upon it, striving to crush it. But her small boot heel did not make an indenture, not a mark upon the little glittering circlet.. In a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth. She wanted to destroy something. The crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear.. A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to discover what was the matter.. ""A vase fell upon the hearth,"" said Edna. ""Never mind; leave it till morning."". ""Oh! you might get some of the glass in your feet, ma'am,"" insisted the young woman, picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet. ""And here's your ring, ma'am, under the chair."". Edna held out her hand, and taking the ring, slipped it upon her finger.. . . . XVIII. . The following morning Mr. Pontellier, upon leaving for his office, asked Edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library.. ""I hardly think we need new fixtures, Leonce. Don't let us get anything new; you are too extravagant. I don't believe you ever think of saving or putting by."". ""The way to become rich is to make money, my dear Edna, not to save it,"" he said. He regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures. He kissed her good-by, and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself. She was unusually pale and very quiet.. She stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house, and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by. She inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown. The boys were dragging along the banquette a small ""express wagon,"" which they had filled with blocks and sticks. The quadroon was following them with little quick steps, having assumed a fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion. A fruit vender was crying his wares in the street.. Edna looked straight before her with a self-absorbed expression upon her face. She felt no interest in anything about her. The street, the children, the fruit vender, the flowers growing there under her eyes, were all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become antagonistic.. She went back into the house. She had thought of speaking to the cook concerning her blunders of the previous night; but Mr. Pontellier had saved her that disagreeable mission, for which she was so poorly fitted. Mr. Pontellier's arguments were usually convincing with those whom he employed. He left home feeling quite sure that he and Edna would sit down that evening, and possibly a few subsequent evenings, to a dinner deserving of the name.. Edna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches. She could see their shortcomings and defects, which were glaring in her eyes. She tried to work a little, but found she was not in the humor. Finally she gathered together a few of the sketches—those which she considered the least discreditable; and she carried them with her when, a little later, she dressed and left the house. She looked handsome and distinguished in her street gown. The tan of the seashore had left her face, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her heavy, yellow-brown hair. There were a few freckles on her face, and a small, dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple, half-hidden in her hair.. As Edna walked along the street she was thinking of Robert. She was still under the spell of her infatuation. She had tried to forget him, realizing the inutility of remembering. But the thought of him was like an obsession, ever pressing itself upon her. It was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance, or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality; it was his being, his existence, which dominated her thought, fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten, reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing.. Edna was on her way to Madame Ratignolle's. Their intimacy, begun at Grand Isle, had not declined, and they had seen each other with some frequency since their return to the city. The Ratignolles lived at no great distance from Edna's home, on the corner of a side street, where Monsieur Ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a steady and prosperous trade. His father had been in the business before him, and Monsieur Ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an enviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness. His family lived in commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side within the porte cochere. There was something which Edna thought very French, very foreign, about their whole manner of living. In the large and pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house, the Ratignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree musicale, sometimes diversified by card-playing. There was a friend who played upon the 'cello. One brought his flute and another his violin, while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano with various degrees of taste and agility. The Ratignolles' soirees musicales were widely known, and it was considered a privilege to be invited to them.. Edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had returned that morning from the laundry. She at once abandoned her occupation upon seeing Edna, who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence.. ""'Cite can do it as well as I; it is really her business,"" she explained to Edna, who apologized for interrupting her. And she summoned a young black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her. She told her to notice particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of Monsieur Ratignolle's, which was missing last week, had been returned; and to be sure to set to one side such pieces as required mending and darning.. Then placing an arm around Edna's waist, she led her to the front of the house, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars.. Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich, melting curves of her white throat.. ""Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day,"" said Edna with a smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them. ""I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I wanted to be doing something. What do you think of them? Do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more? I might study for a while with Laidpore."". She knew that Madame Ratignolle's opinion in such a matter would be next to valueless, that she herself had not alone decided, but determined; but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to put heart into her venture.. ""Your talent is immense, dear!"". ""Nonsense!"" protested Edna, well pleased.. ""Immense, I tell you,"" persisted Madame Ratignolle, surveying the sketches one by one, at close range, then holding them at arm's length, narrowing her eyes, and dropping her head on one side. ""Surely, this Bavarian peasant is worthy of framing; and this basket of apples! never have I seen anything more lifelike. One might almost be tempted to reach out a hand and take one."". Edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her friend's praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth. She retained a few of the sketches, and gave all the rest to Madame Ratignolle, who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly exhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a little later for his midday dinner.. Mr. Ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the earth. His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his goodness of heart, his broad charity, and common sense. He and his wife spoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its un-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation. Edna's husband spoke English with no accent whatever. The Ratignolles understood each other perfectly. If ever the fusion of two human beings into one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their union.. As Edna seated herself at table with them she thought, ""Better a dinner of herbs,"" though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every way satisfying.. Monsieur Ratignolle was delighted to see her, though he found her looking not so well as at Grand Isle, and he advised a tonic. He talked a good deal on various topics, a little politics, some city news and neighborhood gossip. He spoke with an animation and earnestness that gave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. His wife was keenly interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the better to listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth.. Edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them. The little glimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her, gave her no regret, no longing. It was not a condition of life which fitted her, and she could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui. She was moved by a kind of commiseration for Madame Ratignolle,—a pity for that colorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region of blind contentment, in which no moment of anguish ever visited her soul, in which she would never have the taste of life's delirium. Edna vaguely wondered what she meant by ""life's delirium."" It had crossed her thought like some unsought, extraneous impression.. . . . . XIX. . Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles. She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients. She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. She completely abandoned her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called upon her. She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne menagere, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was able, lending herself to any passing caprice.. Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected line of conduct completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her absolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr. Pontellier became rude, Edna grew insolent. She had resolved never to take another step backward.. ""It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family."". ""I feel like painting,"" answered Edna. ""Perhaps I shan't always feel like it."". ""Then in God's name paint! but don't let the family go to the devil. There's Madame Ratignolle; because she keeps up her music, she doesn't let everything else go to chaos. And she's more of a musician than you are a painter."". ""She isn't a musician, and I'm not a painter. It isn't on account of painting that I let things go."". ""On account of what, then?"". ""Oh! I don't know. Let me alone; you bother me."". It sometimes entered Mr. Pontellier's mind to wonder if his wife were not growing a little unbalanced mentally. He could see plainly that she was not herself. That is, he could not see that she was becoming herself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment with which to appear before the world.. Her husband let her alone as she requested, and went away to his office. Edna went up to her atelier—a bright room in the top of the house. She was working with great energy and interest, without accomplishing anything, however, which satisfied her even in the smallest degree. For a time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art. The boys posed for her. They thought it amusing at first, but the occupation soon lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game arranged especially for their entertainment. The quadroon sat for hours before Edna's palette, patient as a savage, while the house-maid took charge of the children, and the drawing-room went undusted. But the housemaid, too, served her term as model when Edna perceived that the young woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that her hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration. While Edna worked she sometimes sang low the little air, ""Ah! si tu savais!"". It moved her with recollections. She could hear again the ripple of the water, the flapping sail. She could see the glint of the moon upon the bay, and could feel the soft, gusty beating of the hot south wind. A subtle current of desire passed through her body, weakening her hold upon the brushes and making her eyes burn.. There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested.. There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know why,—when it did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. She could not work on such a day, nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood.Embed",ESTP

These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns. I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run. I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot. We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'. We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring. I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings. Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take. Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate. See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach. They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'. Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch. Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it. . [Verse 2: Juicy J]. What's the business?. It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank. Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank. Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank. When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint. Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds. Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb. Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel. If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill. [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out.

Lay down on your back so you can get up soon. Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon. Nigga, boom, nigga, boom. . [Verse 4: Lord Infamous]. Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper. Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber. 'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns. Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round. Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down. Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found. Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums. Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm. [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These.... These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out. . [Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]. Here we go, all you weak ass hoes. In my face like you my friend. Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends. Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame. How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man. Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that. Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at. (Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's. (Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's. . [Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]. Parents please, watch out for your children. This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement. Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa. Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'. Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca. Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga. Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'. Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my. . [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth.

Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out. . [Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]. For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change. Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain. Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga. Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing. Counted up a hunnid this mornin'. Then I went spent me 50. Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties. Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich. Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some. Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'. I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'. Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues. Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo. Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club. Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club. Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club. And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub. You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'. I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'. Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie. Don't you ever try to play me, homie. Got a wife now like Kanye. And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce. My daughter 2 months and she been paid. Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate. Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things. Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks. Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left. We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex. Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit. Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch. When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here. Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh. Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it). Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch. . [Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]. Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this. How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics. Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six. So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks. Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank. Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint. If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints. Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank"". It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish. Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas. Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins. Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas. Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year. So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear. Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap. Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap. A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core. I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil. Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor. But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil. Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?). 'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right). Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em. I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm. Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose. Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose. Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes. Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes. . [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out. . [Verse 9: G Herbo]. All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah). My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it). We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch). Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity. Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear. Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?. ""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"". We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody. We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere). We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere). I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere). I do Mike Amiri's, every pair. And they know me for shittin' on everybody. I'm the one that do shit that you hear about. I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama. Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?. Hold on everybody gotta clear it out. Middle of summer, hot like a sauna. We was laid back in the back of the Honda. Told young to sneak up, anaconda. It ain't happen, not one day, your honor. I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's. Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it. All my life I had been in apartments. Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin. My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'. Yes I'm a lil' workaholic. Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's. I'ma just make her count all of 'em. But I get the backend all blues. Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it. Know it's goin' right to lil' dude. Already got a closet, all shoes. Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos. And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs. Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view. I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"". Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool. We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move. I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true). Slept on couches and floors all through middle school. Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool. Now my car go vroom, (vroom). Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool. Guess I got rich too soon. Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?). I seen ten niggas get killed. What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh). Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?. . [Interlude: G Herbo]. Uh, who run it? Limit. No Limit run it. No Limit man. No Limit. Who run it? G Herbo. I'm done with this shit. . [Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]. Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me. Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'. This bust down, tryna scare us or some'. Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'. What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'. Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'. Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'. Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'. Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch. You think I'ma miss that?. Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick. So you think I'ma kiss that?. I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose. Told her I ain't with that. Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck. Mean you better give your wrist back. Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at. Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that. Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh. I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts). Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out. Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back. Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat. Car so foreign got an engine in the back. Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada. With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched. Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy. In Chiraq, 150, be strapped. Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back. Gun loud, backyard party, kick back. How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?. Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats. Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks. After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax. Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island. You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing. Said, ""Elliot, bezel it,"" ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman. Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains. Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion. On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'. You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'. She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'. I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving. . [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth. Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out. . [Verse 11: 21 Savage]. (on God). I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah).

Fuck the bitch right, then I kiss her. Ride around town, you the one who licked her (ew). Ha, real player like my pops (pops). Thirty round in my Glock (doot-doot-doot). We run it, not opps (ha). Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah). Last year. . [Chorus: DJ Paul]. These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth.

Pretty nigga, that indeed. Thottie with me, black and cream. African, Japanese. I just call her blackanese. I'm just gonna tap that and leave. I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door. If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck. So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck. Top floor of the hotel. Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell. Street cold, don't tell. But I'd rather live where it's no hell. It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells. Oh well, my bitch bad. And her pussy got a soap smell. She a model, nah she a model. She a little bougie. And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie. Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody. Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing. Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming. Like I ain't loyal or somethin'. You act like I don't call you or somethin'. You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'. Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?. So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'. Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'. Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'. I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'. I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'. And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'. I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops. And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks. Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps. They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks. Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9. Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign. It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time. But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs. He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said ""uh yeah nigga, four times"". My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time. RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign. Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline. Fuck around and get clotheslined. No ghostwriter, I wrote mine. Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme. They like ""MA, where the album at?"". I just need a lil' more time. I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine. Don't mean I won't blow, ma. Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma. In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine. Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine. Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why. If I had a dick, you could suck it. If I had nuts, you could hold mine. . [Refrain: Young M.A.]. I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine. Haha. If I had some nuts, you could hold mine. Fuck y'all niggas. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. . [Chorus: DJ Paul].

Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang. You ain't gang, treat you like a stain. All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame. I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew. On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2"". New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool. Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool. You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky. Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire. Who want it?

I let her go insane. G-shit in my veins. Limited seats on my plane. Get to the country they know my name. I could pay for anything I'm ordering. Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down. Got 20 inches. I'm rolling up hella green by the pound. You wanna pinch this. Wondering what the stench is. Always played my position. We balling cause we the realest. .... . [Chorus: DJ Paul].

Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed. Too fast, look left, look right. You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight. Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might. Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night. I'm gone, new song comin' soon. Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'. It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do. Been makin' music way before all the views. Whi-white T with the white vans. Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh. Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress. I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next. Sike, bitch, I'm up now. I'm holdin' it down. I'm feelin' great. I cannot frown. ""Who Run It"" remix. Just something light. Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic. Okay. . [Verse 21: Slim Jesus]. Ayy, ayy, gang. Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man. I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit. I be countin' stacks. Who run Ohio, that's me. Which one of y'all hotter than me?. Leave the beat like a hundred degrees. And it's still all this ice on me. Who getting plays like me?. Who getting paid like me?. Y'all was not made like me. And I put that on my G's. Remember they hated on me. I knew all I needed was cheese. Ran it up and I blew it on jeans. Had to run it back up times three. None of y'all wanna be like me. Run around with them pipes like me. Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet. Gold chain on a Polo white tee. In a trap with a whole lot of P's. Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese. I threw bro lil thirty. He threw like fifty to me. All of these rappers is broke. That shit be sickening to me. You blew the whole bag on the road. You look like a victim to me. I just pulled up in a foreign. And you got a Honda on E. All black tints on all my whips. 'Cause I know they're looking for me. Just know wherever I go. It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat. I give a fuck what you claiming you is. You can get touched with the heat. I remember being irrelevant. Now I get bands for all of my feats. Remember totin' tourists. Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees. It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me. You don't really really want the beef. You can talk that shit on the internet. Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets. They was talking crazy last night. 'Til a hundred shots hit they block. I don't even know who got hit with that shit. But we smoking all opps. Everywhere I go I'm with the gang. It's at least three or four of them Glocks. If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks. I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny. You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many. Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me. They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang. . [Bridge: Chris Travis]:. These bitches ain't run, shit but they mouths. These niggas ain't run, shit but they mouths.

Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'. Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'. Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'. I know you hear my Jeep runnin'. I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'. Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'. People look at me and they see money. I'm a boss, d-money. Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'. They like ""Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?"". Bankroll like street money. Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin. . [Verse 39: Chief Keef].

Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?. Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?. 'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in. Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?. Because Ben Franklin is a dead man. Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man. If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man. .

918,918,Disturbed - The sound of silence,"The Sound of Silence Lyrics[Verse 1]. Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping. Left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain. Still remains within the sound of silence. . [Verse 2]. In restless dreams, I walked alone. Narrow streets of cobblestone. 'Neath the halo of a street lamp. I turned my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light. That split the night and touched the sound of silence. [Verse 3]. And in the naked light, I saw. Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening. People writing songs that voices never shared. And no one dared disturb the sound of silence. . [Verse 4]. ""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know. Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you. Take my arms that I might reach you"". But my words like silent raindrops, fell. And echoed in the wells of silence. . [Verse 5]. And the people bowed and prayed. To the neon God they made. And the sign flashed out its warning. In the words that it was forming. And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls"". And whispered in the sound of silence45Embed",ESTP

921,921,Danny Brown - Ain't It Funny,"Ain’t It Funny Lyrics[Verse 1]. Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors. The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors. Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip. Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit. Locksmith of hip-hop, appraisal the wrist watch. The rocks bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth. Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall. Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with Fentanyl. So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift. Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit. Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in. Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in. Live a fast life, seen many die slowly. Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment. [Pre-Chorus]. Funny how it happens who ever would imagine. That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing. . [Chorus]. Ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it?. . [Verse 2]. I can sell honey to a bee. In the fall time, make trees, take back they leaves. Octopus in a straight jacket, savage with bad habits. Broke, serving fiends, got rich, became a addict. Ain't it funny how it happens, who would ever would imagine. Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?. Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage. Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering. Ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it, ain't it funny how it happens?. No way to mask it, a lot became has beens. Rolling up that hundred dollar bill till they cash in. Thinks it gone last, going too fast. Man, it's fucked up, ain't it funny how it happens?. [Chorus]. Ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it?. . [Verse 3]. Ain't it funny how it happens? Upcoming heavy traffic. Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing. Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing. Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing. It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share. Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud. Can’t quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse. Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do. I’ma wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny. Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies. Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy. Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me. Bought a 8-ball of coke and my nigga on the way. Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play. . [Pre-Chorus]. Funny how it happens who ever would imagine. That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing. [Chorus]. Ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?. Ain't it?54Embed",ESTP
922,922,Brockhampton - No Halo,"NO HALO Lyrics[Intro: Kevin Abstract]. I don't know where I'm goin'. If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'. . [Verse 1: Matt Champion]. I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta. Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house. Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy. Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else. Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'. I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass. Late  night corner, we pass. Lick that Swisher, get red. Used to skip rocks 'round that bend. We don't go there no more. We  don't see sun no more. Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI. Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye. Everything 'cept the dog. Everything in the drawers. Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved. [Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help when my. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help when my. . [Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]. Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed. More like God's special mess, never had no halo. Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed. Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in. Mmm, options, runnin' out of options. Mmm, options, used to have options. Mmm, options, runnin' out of options. Mmm, options, used to have options. . [Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract]. I don't know where I'm goin'. If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'. I don't know where I'm goin'. If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'. [Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help when my. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help when my. . [Verse 3: Dom McLennon]. Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams. The pressure put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams. They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream. Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees. The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please. But I believe to an extreme. (That we all can find a way). To anybody listenin' that's in between. (That we all can find a way). . [Verse 4: Joba]. Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit. Been goin' through it again. Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am. Been thinkin' I am better than Him. In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan. Lost a part of me, but I am still here. [Bridge: bearface]. Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute). But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go). Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute). But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go). . [Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help me when my. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my eyes go red. I'm sure I'll find it. No one help me when my, no one help me when my51Embed",ESTP

They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico. . [Verse 2]. Laid in the hot joints, taking the pills. In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill. He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown. You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"". ""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee. If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me. Shot her down because she made me slow. I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more"". [Verse 3]. When I was arrested I was dressed in black. They put me on a train and they took me back. Had no friend for to go my bail. They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail. Early next morning 'bout a half past nine. I spied a Sheriff coming down the line. Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat. He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court"". . [Verse 4]. Into the courtroom, my trial began. Where I was handled by twelve honest men. Just before the jury started out. I saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes, in walked a man. Holding the verdict in his right hand. The verdict read, ""In the first degree..."". I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me"". The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen. Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen. Ninety-nine years underneath that ground. I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down. . [Outro]. Come all, you've got to listen unto me. Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be. [Spoken Word:  Guard & Johnny Cash].

Drifting back into my reality. The subconscious deprecates the day. In the twilight of my own intellect. . Dull is my mind. Captive of illusion. Remaining awake. Is just dust. Take my soul away into the dark. Dreaming a thousand morbid dreams. No tomorrow when the wind caresses my mind. Could I ever return, it would be my doom. . Obsessed by the nightmare's sound. Drifting back into realms of chaos. Reality has become my dream. I'll be covered by the abyss' ground. . An endless fall. Memories in the light. Frontiers of chaos. Return to the eveEmbed",ESTP

Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain. So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet. In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat. Hit somersaults without the net. But this'll be the year that we won't forget. 1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes. Be what you wanna be as long as you know. Consequences are given for livin'. The fence is too high to jump in jail. Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!. Get a life, now they on sale. Then I might cast you a spell. Look at what came in the mail. A scale and some Arm & Hammer. Soul-gold grill and a baby mama. Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers. Stack of questions with no answers. Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS. Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days. Get back home, things are wrong. Well not really, it was bad all along. Before you left adds up to a ball of power. Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour. Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe. Believe there's always more, ha!. [Hook: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]. Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang. Bombs over Baghdad!.

Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep. 75 MCs freestyling to the beat. 'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club. Should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub. Should've held back, but you throwed the punch. Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch. No D to the U to the G for you. Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo. Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan. Never turned my back on my kids, for them. Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top. Before you re-up, get a laptop. Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals. Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal. Record number four, but we on a roll. Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control"". Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya. Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida. Lock all your windows, then block the corridors. Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order. Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter. Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border. Pitty-pat rappers trying to get to five. I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive.

I feel the chaos around me. A thing I don't try to deny. I'd better learn to accept that. There are things in my life that I can't control. . [Verse 1]. They say love ain't nothing but a sore. I don't even know what love is. Too many tears have had to fall. Don't you know I'm so tired of it all. I have known terror dizzy spells. Finding out the secrets words won't tell. Whatever it is it can't be named. There's a part of my world that's fading away. You know I don't want to be clever. To be brilliant or superior. True like ice, true like fire. Now I know that a breeze can blow me away. Now I know there's much more dignity. In defeat than in the brightest victory. I'm losing my balance on the tight rope. Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please. [Chorus]. If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. . [Verse 2]. Hang on to the good days. I can lean on my friends. They help me going through hard times. But I'm feeding the enemy. I'm in league with the foe. Blame me for what's happening. I can't try, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try. No one knows the hard times I went through. If happiness came I miss the call. The stormy days ain't over. I've tried and lost now I think that I pay the cost. Now I've watched all my castles fall. They were made of dust, after all. Someday all this mess will make me laugh. I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait. . [Chorus]. If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. [Bridge]. It's like somebody took my place. I ain't even playing my own game. The rules have changed well I didn't know. There are things in my life I can't control. I feel the chaos around me. A thing I don't try to deny. I'd better learn to accept that. There's a part of my life that will go away. Dark is the night, cold is the ground. In the circular solitude of my heart. As one who strives a hill to climb. I am sure I'll come through I don't know how. They say an end can be a start. Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive. I'm losing my balance on the tight rope. Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please. . [Chorus]. If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number. When it's all over I'll let you know. If I ever feel better. Remind me to spend some good time with you. You can give me your number.

954,954,Aural Vampire - Flare Stack,"Tay Roc vs. Danny Myers Lyrics[Round 1: Tay Roc]. Lately, I'm the one that these fans wanna doubt. You in the way; you shoulda just let this man run his route. Dan wanted clout. Hands comin' out. Boy, I will punch the last bitta teeth outcha grandmother mouth. Punk-ass pussy! Niggas pay you at a low number. Prolly 'cause you dress like you rap... no wonder. You talk like you so gutter. You a whole sucker. I'll make you spit in ya hand and slap ya own mother. Whole summer. Black handle but the slide release chrome color. Surf, he into Cuban chokers; I like throat-cutters. I will smack ya bitch wit' a pistol; her dome rupture. Put her face in front of a mag; she won't make a Voguе cover. This is not a dream. What you, some kinda fiеnd?. When God made you, he needed a beard, some freckles, and a lima bean. I make a violent scene. Demonic as Constantine. Ya momma scream. I make Myers head bust through a wall like Halloween. Whoever gettin' involved gon' be sippin' through straws. Fuck around, y'all gon see D on a shirt—nah, not Christian Dior. This nigga's a fraud. You pissin' me off. I ain't religious; I was just raised to take my problems and give it to God. We wouldn't take you on a mission at all. You give me Tre-from-Boyz-n-the-Hood vibes: you wouldn't get in the car. I got a devillish two-step and I cha-cha with this chopper; we just tryna see if Dan's in with the stars. You got the simplest bars. Ya shit isn't hard. Nigga, I could've said, ""Nah."". And you wouldn'ta even been on the card. Gun Bar King! I don't know Bar God. Matter fact, you ever been hit by a crowbar, Go—?. Close y'all eyes. I promise, if you don't keep it rap, fam. I will open-hand/back-hand slap Dan. Gat sprayin'. Then I dumps da metal in a trash can. I could bring ya ghost out on the stage from what I pack, ma—. Speakina Pac-Man, we brought chopper rounds. You let Rex take twelve K? It would've been ghost everywhere if we had to chase a Dot around. I'll leave ya head wrapped like a Afghan and you how I [?]. You prolly hear them words, ""Head wrap."" and feel sick inside. That head wrap symbolize all them rounds you couldn't memorize. Eazy-E ain't the only nigga from the West that got real sick and died. If we got action, I'm not rappin'. Glocks clappin'. That tranny angle fake, played out, and did not happen. You think it's a joke; I'm not laughin'. It's in the game and you can die over that like John Madden. I will slide past him. My mask only show the eyes. I hop out the van, plottin' on Dan—Cobra Kai. Picture this cornball in a Rolls Royce; I'll be so surprised. Then I'd leave Danny Phantom shot up wit' a ghost inside. Flowers on his grave; he'll be lyin' in a hearse. If a problem arose on the thirtieth, you'll be dyin' on the first. I put two on ya, have 'em cryin' in the church. Show up to the funeral like, ""Shut up! Fuck Dan! D lyin' in the dirt!"". I'll squeeze the butt of this seventeen; shit barely is legal. We like when we see the funeral home buryin' people. This man really evil. I carry a Eagle. This bird cold as The Penguin and you dead if you ain't Danny DeVito. Dan is finito!. Go 'head, rap 'bout how I'm not the best. Scream, ""Yikes!"" until ya veins poppin' out ya neck. 'Cause for this, I told Beas, ""I want a thirty thousand dollar check."". Yeah! You ten years older than me and you get paid twenty-five thousand dollars less. I am not impressed. Tell Dan, ""Settle this shit."" or it's banana clips. Ya damn melon get hit. This Glock is handheld wit' a switch. He ran, fell, and he tripped. All that bass in ya voice; I bet this make Dan yell like a bitch. Don't think you safe just 'cause Geechi and 'em here. I will smack Daniel. Nitty can't save you. In fronta Rum, I'll hop out that 'burban and jack Daniel. Crack Daniel with the black handle. Dead this nigga. Make him bite the curb; use my Jordans to behead this nigga. I will stomp till it split; make ya shit look like a Pez dispenser. I will wreck this nigga. You know what I don't like 'bout ya raps, pussy? The parallel part. Two twin Eagles wit' a parallel arc. We'll pull up on his block; fuck the parallel talk. ""Surf, get him! Eazy, watch him! Chess, parallel park!"". You be rappin' 'bout a parallel universe; don't even got a car to parallel park. Youse a pussy nigga! Rap, nigga! Light bars. [Round 1: Danny Myers]. That shit you did yesterday? Fucked up, disrespectful. Nigga had the streets chatterin'. We gon' calm that down so all my niggas rolled up.... For a piece gatherin'!. This freestyle shit somethin' you ain't able to do. Yesterday, I was gon' flip that bitch but this where I turn the tables on you. (Nigga!). You just said you get paid more than me—cool! Who you finessin'?. Yesterday, all that rah-rah shit—who you was testin'?. Bitch, I will knock the white off yo' teeth then look at Nunu expression. (Ayy! Ayy! Ayy, bitch nigga! Ayy!). From close range or back here, I'm a shell-cooker. The shot just like his shoes: a twelve-footer. (I am the GOAT, nigga! Ayy!). Tay Roc, you think you scarin' us talkin' 'bout squarin' up?. Okay, fair enough. Y'all gon see me throw Roc against the window. (Like I ain't tryna wake her parents up). Our differences are glarin', bruh. This nigga ducked me; I was not hurt. For six years, I let the pot stir. Couldn't even tell Vicky I was gettin' Roc. I'm tryna trigger you, not her. (Don't look so startled.). Glock burst. Head shot. Berettas'll fly. The shit I'll do to Donte, even the Devil may cry. I'll level this guy. It's not a game; get his chest slammed in. Uppercut then I left-hand him. I'll beat his ass even though I carry the baby like Death Stranding. I'm from the West, damn it!. In South Central, no one was good. I'll drag this nigga for miles; morale is low in the hood. Let's get this understood. Ain't no almost-fight wit' me—you touch me, I'll let a dozen out. Ya homies gon' be pourin' out brandy 'cause almost doesn't count. You know what the fuck I'm 'bout?. (Ayy!). I handle mine. Each one-a my mans inclined. To stomp you the fuck out for fake-talkin' like pantomimes. They drag you to the back room, kickin' and stompin', hands is flyin'. That's when I walk through the door like, ""Stop! ... Hammer time!"". (Don't look so startled! Ayy!). This part of a grand design. I'll rip his teeth out; told my man, ""Hand me the pliers."". Smack, ya shooter is gettin' fucked up by Danny The Myers. I'm from a familya riders. You keep a gun? Bitch, ain't nobody scared to go to war witchu. Nigga, my birthday is next week and God blessed me wit' a forty-two. This nigga be gettin' emotional every time that tranny shit get spoken up. Mr. Gun Bars, tongue out, on the bed, legs opened up. To stop them rumors, went and got himself a girlfriend—joke's on us. First time he met Caution, he did a double take, said, ""You not a boy but close enough."". Let's put this in focus, bruh. We know that you gay. You gettin' cut and slayed. Wesley Snipes been showed us the vampire's a fuckin' blade. I'm from a higher order. Knights of the Templar; our bloodline is Myers' aura. My allure'll. Prove you can't fuck with this typa scorcher. Fire torture. Won't survive it unless you got riot armor. Hawk him down with Ks. Ultraviolet rays sight distorter. Strike the [?]. We can be in a gun fight in Georgia. You'll slide across to Florida. Shots'll take you outside where the original land like diaspora. You gon' die in horror. Won't get a chance to hear the organ music. He gon' say, ""That's light!"" then a voice says, ""Yes, son. Now walk into it."". God done proved it. His own losses fueled by the foolish thoughts of humans. I ain't the only one wit' parallels used in rap. View the facts. It's funny how you the Gun Bar King but yo' bitch the one that use the straps. You was the face of the league; we had different views wit' Smack. I was into traffickin' cheese but it turns out youse the rat. I'll shoot you in fronta yo' bitch; peace is what I'm not gon' brang her. Lock on the banger. She tried to cover her eyes before cops could pop the question. She had Roc on her finger. Can y'all imagine pieces of his brain on her wedding finger from his damaged cranium?. All those that doubted the GOAT; now, the man is flamin' him?. Do you believe in a parallel universe?. (I do!). When we first heard them rumors, it put our heads in mania. Then he became Dracula and that nigga's from Transylvania. I wanna believe that you a gangsta. But it's hard for me to get convinced. That you grippin' clips wit' pistol grips. When you're a vampiric thug that sucks blood outta niggas' dicks. (Ayy, bitch!). I lost to Real Sikh but I got you—I know it's burnin' his soul. Any time God takes an L, it turns into gold. I'm from a permanent mode. Get murdered in cold... blood!. On the spot, God. I don't tote the Glock 9. Get hit with that same shit that popped outta RoboCop thigh. I got local block ties. My demeanor'll ruin him. I got people in every neighborhood from 55 and up like a senior community. It ain't a thing you can do wit' me. Shots spread. Clip fulla hot heads. I ain't lettin' offa the trigger until you drop dead. They booked me versus Ave and knew. This ain't the first time I reverse-engineered a Roc to get the block fed. We don't always need big guns. (Cookin' this dumb-ass nigga! Ayy!). I'ma thirty you first then I'm comin' for Tsu. How that sound, Wave? Even the thirty-two hurts. You in the dirt and you on the ground with this shit. This dumb-ass nigga got another two roundsa this shit. (Yikes!). [Round 2: Tay Roc]. Ayy, Danny... Daniel.... You got twelve kids but that ain't what puzzles me. You said ya baby mom took ya twins away when they was two. You ain't get 'em back until they was twenty-three?. When you seen ya kids after not seein' 'em for twenty-one years, how ya face look?. How they find you? Twitter? Poke you on Facebook?. How long was you on child support? How that case look?. Twelve kids in one apartment—how that place look?. I did my homework on this Bar God; I didn't even notice you have a life. Found out he's a battle dad... wit' a battle son... and battle wife!. Reunited with his kids through battle rap—that was nice!. I will make you reunite witcha kids in the afterlife. It gets darker. Trust me, this round is a shit-starter. Fuck a gun bar; when I talk like this, it hits harder. Nigga, as far as bein' a parta ya son life, nigga never had a will—Fresh Prince father. I'ma chip armor. Scrape the blade; make the shit sharper. Let fifteen outta this raptor—Vince Carter. You gon' have a missed son and a missed daughter. I drive by on a Friday and wet up the lawn—""Hey, Ms. Parker!"". I been smarter. Danny don't even respect hisself. He was the nigga in school that rode the short bus and got the extra—. Check yaself or watch ya head leak fast. And ya kids gon' find they father stomped to death—that's a deadbeat dad. Pussy! I ain't gotta use fake angles. Say, ""Thank you!"". I walk in ya crib, catch ya daughter like, ""Hey, angel!"". Then break ankles. She get straight strangled. With strings from my shoe; I pull laces out—Ray Finkle. That broad get hurt. One in her stomach could cause a lossa birth. I'll knock ya son out; 'fore he wake up, I'ma stomp him first. He dizzy, crawlin'; I don't know if his walkin' works. He seein' two of hisself; Spider-Man in the multiver—. You too slow swingin', pussy! Your timin' all late. You'll get slammed on ya face. Ya smile and all scraped. Everything that hit the tile and all ache. I'm not at all fake. This shit'll make body parts break. Knock out a rib, eye, meat, and bone—look like a tomahawk steak. Tell Dan, ""Stop or get everybody in ya fam rocked.. Even ya grams shot for a stack; that's a gram-pop."". My can cocked. I will send you to Paradise. You and the Eiffel Tower got somethin' in common: y'all both parasites. They tellin' me, ""Don't be a menace."" Boy, I'm 'bout to wig out. Like Tre in Dashiki crib, I knock all ya kids out. You got a big mouth and look like you tattle-tat. How you forty-one years old in battle rap with a son that battle rap?. I can't fathom that. Here's where Roc expose. You got twin kids named Malik and Dominique; that's prolly somethin' nobody knows. I'll put ya daughter Dominique in a oven; lock it closed. You won't be comin' home to Dominique; he'll be comin' home to Domino's. Nigga, ¡vamanos!. This shit is fuckin' witcha heart. I'll catch ya son Malik out on the East like, ""Ayy, son. I wanna talk."". Trunk him, take him to Brooklyn, dump him in the park. Since Malik is already known for bein' undercover in New York. Fuck this nigga thought?. You promised me war. Whole time, I got bars 'bout ya kids and... they prolly ain't yours. Fuck around, they gon' found Malik skull. Laid under a Barbie house; I even flip Dominique dolls. Danny, I hate you—true shit. You ain't gon' do shit. Nigga, as a battle rapper and a father, you are useless. I am ruthless. All I know is shoot shit. I'll introduce your twins to these two twins and make quadruplets. Pussy! This hellcat hold fifteen and the shells big. And that's enough for you, ya wife, and ya twelve kids. Leaves the chamber wit' one more bullet to blast from. Chk-chk! Guess who gettin' the last one. Don't stop nothin'; Smack, keep lettin' my clock run. Cut his time short; let me keep goin' till I'm done. Your kids found you 'cause they thought you was lit; I'm not dumb. Met you at Gates of the Garden, thought you had all this money but you ain't got none. That's not fun. Battlin' for crumbs; that shit is senseless. I'm sure all twelve-a ya kids had them a shitty Christmas. These niggas bitches. In the trenches, we do not believe you. Somebody tell Danny the weapon that I got is lethal. I walk in while they doin' surgery on on him; start droppin' people. Grab a blade, mic Myers while I'm starin' at the doctor evil. Deadass!. Ya Pokémon, Charmander head-ass. Greasy head-ass. Boy, I will smack ya Beasley head-ass. Pussy! (Light bars! Fuck outta my face.). [Round 2: Danny Myers]. You said everything that was gon' be achin' that hit the tile and all. That's somethin' that I don't believe. Bitch, if this motherfucker peel, ya soul'll leave. And the lines that came after that wasn't ill either. Nigga, if you make my daughter Domino's, I'm puttin' five in ya lil Caeser. (I am the GOAT!). (Don't panic. I'm too cold. Listen.). I had a conversation wit' a dope fiend, some guy that I knew from years hustlin'. He was surrounded by drugs; his mom tried to steer him clear of it. First time he hit that pipe, his eye swelled up and drew a tear from it. It wasn't until he stood in fronta rock for that second round he knew he'd make a career from it. I speak in metaphor. In that analogy, I give dude his props. But this where I show you there's other ways to use a Roc. Surf was on a down slide while you gave us classics and refused to stop. He started Gun Titles witchu and that's what renewed his stock. I'm speakin' facts now. Niggas always yo' brother when it's time for them to rap rounds. Bars on I-95, you ain't even put him in the background. Did a whole album wit' Mozzy; you ain't get to put a track down. These are some of the burdens that come wit' wearin' Smack's crown. Back down. Surf would never let you out-shine him; look at his mental structure. Phonte has shown us, no matter how ill you are with them bars, you'll always be a little brother. In a parallel universe, you helped Brizz; that night, you didn't move foul. You kept ya respect and we don't view you as the bitch-ass nigga that we do now. When you tell a grown man to suck yo' dick, you can be injured critically. Ninety percent 'cause it's disrespectful, ten percent 'cause we think you mean that shit literally. When you told them white boys to suck yo' dick wit' ketchup on it, you was viewed as a freak. (You said that!). Nigga, ketchup? I don't even want a bitch to do that to me!. You have to see, with all these gun bars, there's no substance. Swallow your pride. Even when he's fully loaded for a round, it's all hollow inside. Why follow this guy?. Our skillsets do not compare. ROC is not cut from the same fabric but I don't know if Roc aware. Y'all think I'm worried about Tay Roc?. (Shut up!). Nigga, I done sold white rock, gray rock. Tan rock, base rock. Granite mineral jade rock. Aboriginal cave rock. Prehistoric fossil rock. Old rock, new rock. Stove top [?] rock. Smooth rock, Moon rock. Color-changin' mood rock. [?]-mixin' street rock. Multi-lava heat rock. You'll go inside a sheet, Roc. You still alive? Then I counterclockwise and re-Rock!. Literally put you forty-seven meters deep... see, Roc!?. The don's onto me. Danny Myers direct wit' Roc without a Hollywood script and Sean Connery. All this gun bar shit from you never made a lotta sense. Niggas threw his chain in a fast food trashcan; he ain't been to McDonald's since. What happened to all them big MACs you be holdin'? He ain't hit the block wit' his man. Nah, I'm frontin'—he did some gangsta shit and got his revenge. He rounded up six of his meanest assassins; Edgewood niggas come from a trife road. They kicked in the do', started recordin', and one of 'em slapped a white girl. Really, my nigga? Violence against a woman?. I mean, it's sad to say. When you snatch fake chains from a viscious murderer, somebody has to pay!. This ain't even my savage stage. I'm spittin' passion past the rage. Only a single mother amassed with eight bastard case kids listenin' half the way to Donny Hathaway ""This Christmas"" could rap this way. I do this for practice—ayy!. This shit finna get spooky, Tay Roc. You think you'll survive a head-on collision with a hawk? I'm Mookie Blaylock. (Bar God!). Look out ya window; it's a speedin' Denali in view!. Outta-state plates; peep what a team from Cali'll do. Before he grabs his phone and he can rally a crew. All we know is a bitch dies in the season finale of you. You wanna know how ice-cold these murders can get?. (Yeah, Joe!). I'll demonstate 'em. Eliminate him. Veer in ya villa wit' villians from Venezuela. Smashin' ya brain, maskin' a blade like this is Vega. Catchin' bodies midway through the air like figure skaters. Niggas hate us. I ain't gon' play with the cartridge; I'm sicka Sega. Disintegrate his whole village; make it the biggest crater. These niggas wanna gamble with they life? We innovators. Mafia members witnessin', envisionin' to build a Vegas. I'm still the greatest. Y'all remember that blue-haired chick he was wit'? That bitch was bad that a motherfucker. I look at her... then I look at Caution... I get sad than a motherfucker. They say when a nigga wit' a ugly bitch, it's 'cause the head's good. What would make a man fall off that far? I figure a nigga from the Edge—. Listen! You are not the man that you think you are. Scared to tell Caution you don't really fuck wit' her. You let her ugly ass move her son in witchu and now you feel like you stuck wit' her. You are not the man that you think you are. You always lookin' frail here. If I ask Chess, can he beat you up, he gon' look at me and say, ""Hell yeah!"". You are not the man that you think you are. Leadership ain't money and things. He raps the Cave wit' a bat signal but no one's under ya wing. You are not the man that you think you are. You don't realize that you dead, kid?. You are not the man that you think you are, bitch nigga, 'cause Fred is. I am the GOAT and he on the ground with this shit. This dumb-ass nigga got a whole 'nother rounda this shit. . [Round 3: Tay Roc]. Mike P exposed that yo' wife is a crackhead and that boy is the weakest. (Your wife is a crackhead!). Vicki Myers? I'd be lyin' if I said that shawty is decent. Ayy, Smack, I wouldn't touch that bitch. Plus, how the fuck Mike P know all Victoria's secrets?. You genius!. You met a crackhead and said that you got to keep her?. I will make her sniff a line off my Glock then cock that Nina. You will see a hole through her head when I pop the heater. I will have it smokey in that junkie bitch face—bye, Felicia!. You a bottom-feeder. You not the leader. Kick in ya door, give ya mom a seizure. Then stuff her inside a freezer. I ain't lyin', neither. Chopper-squeezer. Watch arms come from the waist, in the air, into the head like the Macarena. I ain't tryna wrestle like Tommy Dreamer. Give Roc a cleaver. Stab him; it go through D back like a wide receiver. Oh, you a non-believer?. That's until I put this stick with the mercury tips in his mouth, check if he got a fever. This man is a faggot. My shooter handle a ratchet. Rental car in L.A. lookin' for this man up in traffic. This nigga better have a Lambo to dash it. You will be a dead bitch in that car unless Danica Patrick. Stupid nigga play hisself; I am the man in this rap shit. Turn this to a funeral; we got cameras to catch it. I'll open up a coffin, put Dan in it backwards. Close it up then Triple H sledgehammer the casket. Tragic. I will make it more than rap. You'll get a phone call that your daughter clapped. And ya son dead; imagine the thoughta that. I brought a strap. For ya wife, Vic; she got outta pocket, tried to run, and the eagle caught her back. They want more-a that. (Pussy! They want more-a that, nigga! Yeah, nigga! Fuck outta here.). Scalpula to ya scalp. Split brains. Rip veins. I make it stick in a skull like a pimp cane. Knife'll get stuck. A spike in the front like a Knick ga—wait. This nigga Danny married a junkie; that shit strange. I should run up blowin' her nose since she sniff 'caine. Ain't shit changed. Don't get shot in ya mouth. Your wife is a real life crackhead and you don't want her to see Roc in ya house. I heard she'll sniff a bird till she fall out in bed. Meat tenderizer; I will beat that chicken thought out her head. She be layin' there, shiverin' while y'all in the bed. And Vicky gon' relapse 'cause I'm fittin' all us in ya crib. (Pussy!). SIG drawn, hit ya kid. Daughter and son get murked. Boy, I will flip ya house upside-down—WonderWorks. Let somethin' burst. (Pussy!). All I know is chaos. Unloadin' ARs. To talk to you again, ya kids gon' have to hold a séance. I don't know what they on. I just a hundred twenty-seven six two standin' up in a box look like Crayola crayons. These shits'll mangle a vest. All that shit you was talkin' gon' change in a sec. You shoulda came in correct. Aim wit' a Tec. Bang! Hit his neck. For a ban, Dan'll get set on fire; that's gang disrespect. This lame nigga deaf. Soccer mom van when niggas slide. Door open, hop out, drag this man up in the ride. To a two-car garage. One spot's for the van to get inside. The rest of the space is big enough so Dan can fit inside. (Bitch!). I bring Chess wit' me on a mission to ya house, start sprayin' slugs. Ya dumb-ass wife Vicky ain't hear us break in; she nodded off takin' drugs. Lil bro got point black range to bang the snub. Now, the blood of Vic's all over Chess; it's vapor rub. Ya son Malik get pistol-whipped if he plannin' to run. Then I'ma Mr. Miyagi crane-kick Daniel's son. Damage done. (Pussy! Youse a pussy nigga! I fuckin' hate you, pussy!). Fuck how ya daughter Dominique feelin'. I'll bang her with the hawk and make Dominique Wilkins. (Pussy!). I do not respect Dan. Turn you to a pack; you are about to become the best strand. I'm smokin' on a dead man. Like Method Man and Redman. Lead blam. You gon' need a X-ray, head scan. Brace for ya neck, shit bag, and bed pan. I'm right-handed; I shoot it till the Tec jam. But it's ugly; it look like I drew it wit' my left hand. (You stupid motherfucker! This is me! You could never fuck wit' me! You could never! All that gas they gave you. This is my shit, nigga. You're dead! It is me!). Deadass!. Your Squirtle-Wartortle-Ninja Turtle-lookin' head-ass. Greasy head-ass. Boy, I will smack ya Beasley head-ass. Light bars, nigga. . [Round 3: Danny Myers]. That nigga brought up my wife; I knew he would throw a shot. (Chill out! There are those that do this and there are those that are born to do this.). That's why I crept up, waitin' him to come out for about four o' clock. I load the Glock. Vicky said, ""Nah. Lemme throw the shot.. This gon' be easy. I spent most my life smokin' rock."". (I am the—ayy! Bitch-ass nigga!). You will really get smothered out here. Said crayons? Nigga, this L.A.; we been knew about colors out here. I wanna teach this nigga; why the fuck they thought the man could test us?. I drew it with the right then the left—bitch, I'm ambidextrous!. (I am the GOAT!). (Ayy, y'all, I'm really the GOAT out here, bro. Chill out. Lemme bring it home. Let's bring home a classic. Let's bring home a classic, y'all.). Ever since I got in this battle rap world, I knew I'd go to the top. I was right at the door but these niggas was controllin' the locks. Now, I'm on stage, point blank range, unloadin' a shot. Extravaganza; Adam Sandler died the same way, over a rock. If it's war waged, these four walls gon' absorb pain. Like a smuggler's kis tossed in a duffle, I proceed wit' caution through a crawl space. Blood pour stains on my North Face. While me and Jorge carve shapes and make sorbet out ya whore brain wit' a sawblade. Gourmet not be how y'all handle beef but it's our way. My clan's insane. This ya last chance to plan a change. Or spend ya lastin' days hands in face in fronta the candle flame. Tryna rebuke the viewa ya bitch movin' stupid in the back 'cause you can't stand the rain. What did you stand to gain?. Don't you want more children?. Why would you want fours spittin'?. If you and Caution planned parenthood, you better abort mission. This battle is a morgue visit. Mortician. More friction. Wit' one hand, I point and annoint the dead; get his corpse Christian. Boy, listen. How our legacies got the same span. When fame can have you spittin' in the face-a ya main man?. Nigga, I'm from gang land. If a bitch ever came between me and my nigga, it was a train ran. A whore is nothin' sacred. Growin' up complacent. Pourin' out liqour for niggas who ain't old enough to drink it. My aura's of the ancients. Get stabbed or burned with the Glock. But if this pearl jam, you'll get the alternative, Roc. Surf, I'm talkin' to you, too. We smashin' pumpkins in a lot, fam. As soon as that link in park, the killers come out, snatchin' Roc bands. You'll fall out, boy; when the beef is on, we lock and load. Pull up to his house, bumpin' Chuck Berry, ready to shoot the father of Roc and roll. He tried to lock the do' but fuck that; the Glock'll burn. Shot his auntie, popped the dog, shot the urn. He fell face first—is he dead? I'm not concerned. Kick him over, shoot him again—I'll leave no Roc unturned. Even though it wasn't Easter, somethin' odd occured. The moment Roc moved from in fronta the cave, God emerged. I am the resurrection of battle rap. They been debatin' for decades who the best; this settles that. I'm tellin' Smack. From this point on, my money doubles up. No more new niggas, no more such-his-face and fuckin' fuck-and-such. Where the fuck is Lux?. We can step today. The moment he chooses to take this L, you ex the way. Accept the pay. Fifty K is what my Venmo gon' say. Then I kill that other nigga from Harlem 'cause murder is my M.O., okay?. I am the resurrection of battle rap. Look at the pictures that I draw, clown. Ten Commandments. God himself used rock to lay the law down. Ask the staff; at first, they didn't wanna follow my greatness. Now, I'm surrounded by parallel lines like the numbers fallin' in Matrix. I am the resurrection of battle rap. I gave y'all, ""Come outside."" Restore Order. Swave stole it and been havin' fun wit' it. Y'all motherfuckers wanna take my flow and run wit' it?. That's cool; I was the first one wit' it. Bar God!Embed",ISFP

The son and lieutenant of Constantine, elected emperor by the Roman troops before their abandonment of Britain. Dr. Guest, Master of Balliol, supposed Aurelius Ambrosius to have been his son, and Caradoc Vreichoras his grandson.

See Preface, also the list of Arthur's battles in Tennyson's ""Elaine,"" borrowed from that of Nennius, who composed a history of Britain in perhaps the seventh or eighth century. Mr. Nicholson, Bodley's librarian at Oxford, England, supposes the first four conflicts to have been in Lindsey (""the region Linuis"" of Nennius); but the names of the streams themselves, except the Glem, are found in or near the lake country of the northwest. Either supposition accords well with our story, which has nothing directly to do with any battle of Arthur before that in the forest of Celidon.. Caowl. [Page 18. In the long poem, sometimes called an epic, entitled the ""Gododin,"" Aneurin gives a savage picture of Caowl, but says also ""breathless in the presence of a maid would he distribute the mead,"" a tribute to woodland bashfulness!. Argoed. [Page 24. This has a general meaning of [Page 398] woodland. More particularly it seems to have been applied to the region which owned Llywarch as its lord. In his ""Death-song of Cyndylan"" he refers to ""the men of Argoed"" as his own especial following. There are passages in this poem of epic dignity, martial force, and poignant pathos.. Dynan. [Page 25. Pronounced between Doonan and Dunnan, say Doi-nan.. The White Town. [Page 26. This was the city Uriconium, the emporium of the Welsh mining-districts, near the eminence known as the Wrekon, and on the site occupied by the present Wroxeter. The circuit of its wall about equalled that of London. Its buildings were roofed with a stone which contained many particles of mica, giving a beautiful effect. It is identified by Dr. Guest with the ""White Town, the town of flame"" of Llywarch. It was taken by storm in the final conquest of the Severn valley, as its ruins yet show.. Calleva Atrebatum, which the Britons called Caer Segeint, is now represented by the small town of Silchester. Its forces marched under the eagle standard after the Romans had withdrawn. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Arthur was here elected and crowned by a great assembly of the nobility and clergy of the realm. It was, at all events, hardly inferior to London after the latter waned under the stifling effect of the Saxon blockade, and must always have been more beautiful.. Osburn. [Page 26. This Frank mercenary is a type of the Teuton free lances who were then serving Rome and Rome's enemies, and every semi-independent power. Naturally the city of London would have some of them in the guard of its wall and gates.. Caer Collin. [Page 33. Colchester. Present county seat of Essex. Ancient capital of ""Old King Cole,"" according to ballad and legend; also of the historic Cunebelline, Shakespeare's Cymbeline, the ""friend of Augustus."" It was in Roman times one of the great cities of Britain, and the [Page 399] centre of many industries, but had no doubt long been dwindling before the period with which we deal, being often threatened and sometimes quite surrounded by the East Saxons and their allies.. Andred-wood. [Page 33. The greatest wilderness of Britain, which ran east and west parallel with a great part of the southern coast. There was a mining-population in it, besides foresters of every kind. The great fortress town of Anderida, called by the Saxons Andred Ceaster, derived its name from this wood, and was aided by that hardy population in its obstinate resistance to Elle, the conqueror of Sussex. Long after London fell, the forest of Andred offered an asylum to all sorts of fugitive Britons.. Guledig. [Page 39. Guledig, or Wledig, was the Celtic equivalent of Emperor. Thus the tale known as ""The Dream of Maxim Wledig"" has to do with the Emperor Maximus. Tigernach, being an extreme reactionary Briton and Celt, would use the native title instead of any foreign equivalent. The mistletoe, sacred to the Druids, had been chosen, we will suppose, as a token among their adherents, and was also the cognizance of Prince Cian.. Waters of the Sun. [Page 54. Aquæ Solis, the modern Bath. It was not destroyed until after Arthur's death. In the Saxon ""Codex Exoniensis"" appears a very impressive metrical meditation of one of the victors, attesting the extraordinary beauty, luxury, anal attractiveness of the place. ""They perished in wide slaughter."". Cian's chariot. [Page 60. It has been thought that some relics indicate the use of chariots in battle as late as the ninth century. They were the distinctive war-engines of ancient Britain. In the Celtic revival from the sixth to the eighth centuries they would naturally reappear after their long disuse during Roman times. But in the earlier part of this period they must have been a rarity, so that Cian, the conservative in [Page 400] opinion though daring in action, would be nearly alone in his fancy.. The legend. [Page 65. It is a very old one, illustrated by some of Cunebelline's coinage.. Vran. [Page 70. This demigod, or half-deified magician, seems to have been a special champion of London at a very early date. The Welsh triads mention him.. Aesc of West Kent. [Page 70. In the confusion and overlapping of the waves of Saxon invaders, there were even for a time two kings within the limits of what is now one county. West Kent was not a kingdom of long duration, yet it existed.. The Song of Cian. [Page 74. Our hero is mentioned by Nennius as one of the four great poets of Arthur's time. So late as the French Revolution a manuscript book of his poems is said to have been extant in Brittany. They may yet possibly be recovered. A single song attributed to him, of a mystical and figurative character, has been taken down from the recitation of peasants in that province. I have endeavored to be faithful to its tone and quality, being without other guide.. Caerleon. [Page 76. Caerleon on Usk, having yet its living representative. This was the main seat of Arthur's court, preserving much of Roman splendor. It affords the scene and personages of the Mabinogion tales in the ""Red Book of Hergest."" It is ""the city Leogis, called Cair Lion"" of Nennius. Here also ""the neighing of the wild White Horse set every gilded parapet shuddering."". Basilica. [Page 78. In Roman cities this was a combination of court-house, public hall, trade-guild, office-building, and merchants' exchange, but was usually of great beauty.. Eschwine. [Page 83. London was probably taken and destroyed or depopulated by Sleda, the son of Eschwine, soon after Arthur's death. The father, having recently given over sea piracy, and established himself on the land, was not [Page 401] likely to be more clement at the time of our tale. A chief of the Northern Saxons was known by the parallel title of ""Flame Bearer."". Maelgwn. [Page 105. Monsieur de Villemarqué was, I believe, the first to identify this Prince of North Wales with the legendary Lancelot. Gildas berates him as a very guilty man, but gives him credit for strength, gallantry, and the possession of high qualities which might have been turned to better account. He appears as a paroxysmal, vain, self-seeking character, extravagant in sinning and repenting, yet foremost in ability after Arthur's fall. By some priestly subterfuge, known as ""the affair of Corsfechno,"" he seems to have acquired supremacy. He was probably the Conmael who fell with two other great chiefs in defending the lower Severn valley and its cluster of commercial cities when the next wave of Saxon invasion rolled that way. Geraint, coupled with him, is mentioned by Aneurin, and made the hero of a vehement and splendid poem by Llywarch. There is no reason to doubt that Geraint was a real person, very possibly ""a tributary prince of Devon, one of the great order of the Table Round,"" as Tennyson puts it in the ""Idylls of the King."". Camelot. [Page 105. Camelot was probably a newly founded fortress city, which Arthur made his frontier capital, that he might the better watch his most dangerous enemy, Cerdic of Wessex, who had penetrated some distance into the land on this frontier. The site of Camelot was most likely Cadbury Hill, near Queen's Camel, in Somersetshire. Merlin is identified by legend with the building of the place, and dwellers thereabout are said to retain a certain wizardly repute even yet.. A stronghold built on piles. [Page 106. The lake or great marsh below London probably gave that city its name, ""Lyn-dyn,"" the lake-fort. It must have afforded a refuge and fastness to the Britons, and maintained its race of marsh-[Page 402] men, as did the fens and watery wastes that lay farther to the north. The piles of buildings which were supported in this way above the water have been found within the limits of the metropolis. There is no unlikelihood in a complete lake-village of that time and place.. Arthur Mabuter. [Page 110. The word Mabuter has been generally translated ""the son of Uther."" One of the British poets refers to him as ""the son of Uther before he was slain."" But Dr. Guest insists that it should be rendered ""the terrible boy,"" in allusion to his youth on first assuming command.. The Song of Llywarch. [Page 116. In these verses I have preserved the rhyme, arrangement, and metre of Llywarch's ""warrior triplet,"" which may have indirectly suggested such modern poems as ""Hohenlinden"" and ""Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled."" The white-horse standard referred to was that of the Saxons under Cerdic. The charge in white armor is from Geoffrey of Monmouth, who puts the number who fell with Ambrosius at five thousand. The Saxon Chronicles mention the death of Natanleod, King of the Britons, at the same time and place. Dr. Guest considers it to be a title, meaning Prince of the Sanctuary, meaning the ""holy house at Amesbury,"" which had been named after him, and was known as the great Choir of the Dominion. Later it was removed to Glastonbury, known as Avalon, where Arthur himself was laid quietly to rest at the end, being borne in a boat over the flooded land.. Guinevere. [Page 121. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, her name was Guanhumara. The Scotch peasants make it Wander. Guinevere was a Normanized version. It is likely also that the Normans invented Lancelot as a substitute for Maelgwn.. The Queen of London. [Page 132. An old Welsh manuscript says, ""Wherefore the kings of London were called the sons of Alis."" Dr. Freeman says there are indica-[Page 403] tions that London, in its early Saxon history, maintained a kind of local supremacy, having under it the tributary territory of Middlesex.. Verulam. [Page 181. St. Alban's.. Caer Lerion. [Page 190. Ratæ of the Romans. Leicester.. Legiolum. [Page 191. Castleford.. Freur. [Page 201. Llywarch mentions his sister Freur in one of his poems.. A woman-like form. [Page 203. The people of the under-world and wonder-world are too important components of early British story to be neglected. We find the lady of the hollow hill in one of the Mabinogion stories; and the experiences of Kilmeny, Childe Roland, and Thomas of Ercildoun show what might befall. Curiously, some of the hills, on excavation, have been shown to be both hollow and once inhabited. There is some element of truth in most superstition. It has been suggested that a primitive aboriginal race, driven to underground shelter and the depths of forestry, and able to keep alive only by secrecy and subtlety, may have made reprisals, including abductions, in a terrifying way, so that the fear of them as mysterious, flitting, and superhuman, would linger on indefinitely.. The Scaur. [Page 208. The Victoria caverns of the King's Scaur were first adequately explored and described by Professor Boyd Dawkins, author of ""Cave-Hunting."" The relics in them show that refugees from ruined northern cities, like Isurium, atone time took refuge there; this occupancy lasting until civilization was in part worn away, or until they made room for more barbarous successors.. Caer Badus. Caer Gloui. [Page 218. Bath and Gloucester.. The wreck of Isurium. [Page 226. This city, according to Dr. Green, was hardly inferior to Eboracum (York), [Page 404] which exceeded London in importance. The destruction by the Saxons was complete.. Caer Ebrauc. [Page 230. This was now Eboracum, now York.. Prince Edyrn. Edyrn of the Scarlet Coat was a notable British champion of the preceding generation. ""Sanawg, or stately maiden,"" is named in a poem of ""The Graves of Britain,"" author not certain. Gwydion ap Don had a great celebrity for necromantic feats, including the very pretty one commemorated in the fragment of a chant which haunted Llywarch's fancy.. Loidis. [Page 249. Leeds.. Borne far away. [Page 285. If you ask who carried Dynan away, ""I cannot tell so mote I thrive."" His name is a very old one; he provides a part of the fanciful-mystical element of our romance. Thus in the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel"" we have a [Page of preterhuman qualities and abilities, although it is a true picture of its time.. In Lady Guest's Mabinogion, taken from the fourteenth century ""Red Book of Hergest,"" you will find the story of Araun, the Lord of Announ, and Powyll, Prince of Dyfed, in which the mystic lady of the hollow hill appears as ""Rhiannon of unspeakable beauty,"" riding out of the under-world on a white horse, with a garment of shining gold around her. Without effort she distanced all pursuers. Archæologists have found, curiously enough, that some of the mounds popularly called Pechts' houses in North Britain, and believed to be haunted by fairies, actually had within them chambers fitted up for human occupancy. Mr. MacRitchie argues ingeniously that there was a small aboriginal race which took refuge in them, issuing by night into the outer air, and occasionally abducting the women or children, or even the men, of the conquering race. Dr. Rhys attributes, conjecturally, the liveliness of the Irish, as compared with the Welsh, to the greater amount of fairy blood in them.. [Page 405]. The modern concept of the fairies is a very complex one, deriving something, no doubt from the light and shadow of inanimate nature and mere fantastic day-dreaming. Yet back of them troops a more impressive array, the dread lords and ladies of the lower realm, in some part the dethroned deities of divers heathen mythologies, but no doubt even more the memories of dispossessed human beings who lurked on in the shadow, perhaps long after they had ceased to be thought of as flesh and blood by people who were free to come and go as they would in the daylight. Our Dynan is not historic, he is typical, and by no means the only one for whom this dread parentage has been claimed. Let us not be over curious as to whether he were borne into a spectral under-world of magic and faery, or into some dusky refuge of a last lingering fragment of a most archaic but purely human race. In the thrill and twilight of mystery must Romance ever find her home.. White Hill of Cynvelyn. [Page 295. This seems to have been the hill of the Tower of London.. Caer Ligion. [Page 341. Now Chester. One of the last of the Romano-British cities to be taken by the Saxons. Two hundred years afterward it remained a ruin; but the great walls were used by the Northmen as a defence when hard pressed, as the ruins of Uxmal might be used by a Mexican or Central American expedition now.. Trath Tribuit. [Page 341. This battle of the strand, which has no very direct relation to the main current of our tale, is mentioned in Nennius, and in the poems of the ""Black Book of Caermarthen,"" the oldest of the Welsh manuscripts, a few fragments only excepted. The spelling varies through several intermediate forms, from Trath Tribuit to Traeth Trywruid. It is located at many widely separated points by different investigators. The mouth of the Ribble is an old suggestion, which, on the whole, has the most to commend it. The word Trath, or Traeth, is translated the sandy [Page 406] shore of an estuary. The Ribble mouth answers to this; the name is more like Tribuit than that of any similar spot which the Saxons had any temptation to reach; and it is not easy to invent any other probable scheme of their semi-naval campaign.. Caer Caradoc. [Page 358. This was Amesbury, the town of Ambrosius, where the Holy House mentioned by Arthur in Tennyson's Guinevere was or had been located; a religious establishment very likely as great as that of Bangor, which is said to have sent a thousand unarmed priests to the final battle before the walls of Chester, where they were slain while praying. At the time of which I write, it is probable that the religious element had withdrawn to safer quarters in Avalon, and that the character of the town was chiefly military. Dr. Guest identifies Amesbury with the provincial capital of Caradoc Vriechvras, Prince of Devon and son of Aurelius Ambrosius.. City of Vortigern. [Page 361. Old legends make Gloucester the capital of Vortigern, or Vor Tighairn, the British king or emperor who invited Hengist and Horsa into Kent.. Battle of Camelot. [Page 362. This is the Cat Bregion, or battle of the Mount Breguoin of Nennius. The name has been explained by Dr. Skene as meaning the painted hill; and Cadbury, with triple walls of eartwork, and buildings painted after the Celtic fancy, gay-colored banners, and the many richly apparelled chiefs and followers, would answer to that name very well. First or last, the British frontier capital was sure to be assailed. But there can be no such certainty in the identification of the battle of Mount Breguoin as in the case of Mount Badon, which is put by the note of the monks of Glastonbury on their copy of Gildas at a point near Bath and the Avon River; or in the case of Cair Lion, which is still Caerleon on Usk.Embed",ISFP

960,960,Tessa Violet - Haze,"Haze Lyrics[Verse 1]. I used to be. Overwhelmed by every little thing. Torn apart, unraveled at the seams. I think it rooted in the way I breathe, mm. And I get drunk. On a boy who asks me if I'm up. Tells me he can't understand his luck. To know me, to love me. To hold me, show up. I'll be your empathetic savior. Call me up, I'll meet you later. You can praise me for the way. I always know just what to say. I'll carve into your ribs. And leave you crying for a kiss. Just for kicks. Hmm. [Chorus]. Cause nothing satiates me. And I don't think that I hate me. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze. And nothing overtakes me. And I think I'm going crazy. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze of mine. . [Verse 2]. I met a boy. Who never knew the taste of haze. To him the whole world is a stage. While I am fifty shades of beige. Sometimes I think. Is this the way I'm supposed to be?. Was I just built differently?. Or is there something wrong with me?. Cause there's a circuit in my chest. Unconnected from the rest. Of my mind and its the spot. Where my words are getting caught. And I try to walk it off. But my brain is filled with fog. Disconnecting my mouth from my thoughts. [Chorus]. Nothing satiates me. And I don't think that I hate me. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze, oh. Nothing overtakes me. And I think I'm going crazy. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze of mine. Hmmm. Hmm-mmm. Hmm-mmm-mmm. . [Chorus]. Nothing satiates me. And I don't think that I hate me. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze. And nothing overtakes me. And I think I'm going crazy. But bad or good. Seems nothing could. Take away this tasteless haze of mine7Embed",ISFP

But I came out at a basement, uh. Mom wanted me to be a doctor, uh. But I came out as a patient, uh (Oh, oh). Now I get a thousand DMs every day. I had a fan telling me that I saved him (For real). Saying that he loving everything I make. And I couldn't take a single second out my day to make his (Uh). I'm just getting number every time I see my numbers  (Yeah). Every time I see the bottom, every time we see each other (Yeah). Every time I pop a bottle, every time I hit the lotto. Every time I see tomorrow, I just really want another (Uh, uh, uh). I'm just stuck between the gutter in the rain, and the pain that I'm feelin', but. It's somethin' in the same kinda vain that I'm healin' from (Yeah). I wonder why I feel so little. 'Cause I ain't been on the top, I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm somewhere in the- middle, yeah. [Chorus 2: Quadeca & William Bell].

I know this'll make 'em proud, but I know they gon' need another And another, and another, and another, and another. Like I'm DJ Khaled with a motherfuckin' stutter. 'Kay, yeah... today I woke up. Grabbed my phone to check the 'gram, I started scrolling. Got a message from a dude without a profile picture. Shit was long as fuck, I thought that he was trollin'. So I tried to swipe it out, but accidentally must'a opened. I said, ""Fuck it, guess I'll read it now that's it already loaded"". Had a sudden premonition, but it faded in the moment. So I focused, started reading, let me try my best to quote it. As he wrote it, it said: ""My homie was a huge fucking fan. Used to play your shit every day. He struggled with depression. And he told me that the music was the thing that always set him straight. But I guess it must of gotten too much for him. Killed himself a couple months back, it's felt so fucking long. But it reminded me of him when you popped up on my page. And I went and started listening to a couple songs, so.... ...Keep doing you, bro"". He followed up with a post from his friend, it was a screenshot of my track. I clicked the profile full of ""R.I.P.""s. And the comments, shit, I couldn't even stomach looking at. But all the sudden, in the instant, everything felt grimmer. Read the name again, and realized it sounded familiar. Clicked the DM, to see if he had talked to me before. Saw this was the same kid I consciously ignored (Every-). A couple months ago. [Chorus 3: Quadeca & William Bell]. I swear, they only love me when I'm not there (So what? So what? Yeah! Yeah! So what?) (-body loves a winner-winner). I know you trust me, but I don't care (What? Yeah!). I swear that I don't care (No! I don't care!). I know you love me, but I don't care (So what? So what?). . [Outro: Quadeca]. Apathy. There's no reason to be mad at me. That's just how it has to be13Embed",ISFP
